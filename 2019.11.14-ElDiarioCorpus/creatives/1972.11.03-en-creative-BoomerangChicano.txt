Boomerang Chicano-
When I went to college we didn't have UMAS or EOP programs to help us through. . It was every man for himself. . . I figured the best way to help my RAZA was to make it. . .you know. . .set an example. . .
When those Chicano militants started all this Chicano power stuff, I saw right away it wouldn't work. . .1 mean I’m as proud to be Spanish-surnamed. . but you have to work through the system. . .
So when the War On Poverty began and when the HEW and OEO programs began, I saw my chance to help my RAZA and still work through the system. . .besides it pays $17,000 a year!
