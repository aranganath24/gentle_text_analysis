The police force being unable to capture el tortilla kid for the brutal beating he gave two police officers have sent for the son of that great all American George Wally but it appears that everyone is in for a surprise.
In the office of the chief of police.
Hello I'm George Wally Jr. 
Jesus Christ No, No.
Who did you expect? The white knight?
You couldn't be, I mean your father was so.
Oh don't worry daddy taught me everything he knew. Watch this.
SOCK. FALL. OOF.
Well.
Don't know why dad makes me wear this dumb sheet. 
KICK. BAM. POW.
Having finally convinced the chief of police to give him a chance.
Now here's my plan.
Next dat at a local high school, in the chicano barrio we find two suspicious looking characters.
Let's hurry and arrest some Mexicans.
DOn't you think you oughta take off your badge first?
The police are ready to make a bust on the students in hopes of el tortilla kid showing up. Little do they know he's there, somewhere and he already knows.
Pot, acid, coke, glue smack, speed, enchiladas!
The students are informed. 
And you three take the Frito bandit. 
Hey bro, what you got there?
The enemy has been signed get ready to move in men, and one more thing remember the Alamo!
Those are the two biggest nuts I've ever seen.
The people are all in their places and everything is ready to happen be here next time when we will see George Wally JR. (the Co Clux CuCu) meet el Tortilla Kid.
