A poem by TigreHuman Leaves / Ask my burning face! Ask my broken hands! Long, long row of fruit, floating in a green pea / It really doesn't do us any good. I swear to the sky above me. / swear at the crew leader's back. I damn the farmers. We are just like those leaves in front of me. Confused, bewildered, lost and amazed  Not knowing where we came from. Not knowing where we shall go. Human leaves that have reached autumn, Before the human tree ever bloomed Don't tell your painless life because I don't know pain your way. A hardship for you is a way of life for me. You eat well, my mouth waters as I see the pictures of food in the magazine. I waste my time to tell you my plight because you don’t see me. On the other hand I know everything about you one way. We are human leaves buried in your hideous soul. For we only know what you tell us. For we are sick of you. Human leaves harsh and bitter, grasping for the truth.
