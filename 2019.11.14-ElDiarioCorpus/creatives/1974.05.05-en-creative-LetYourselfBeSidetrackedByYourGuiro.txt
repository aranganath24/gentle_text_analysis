Let yourself be sidetracked by your guiro
let yourself be sidetracked by your guiro carnal let yourself be free to do your music when your heart pounds in the melody of your ringing ears unto death do not allow your love to pass unto life embrace other camales help each other sweat the day away eat your tortillas together camales we gotta share our joys in the Quetzal pride on the pyramid of sun glaze birth get together make your music make your canto raza make your barrios make your lives camales make la raza live unto life Juntos bajo el sol de nuestros padres
