exercise in futility
Our Father which art in Heaven Maria, go to church Y ores por mi Y ores por mi hijo Que va a nacer. Go to church, Maria. Nothing can save you now, Only Good, And I heard Good died. Was crucified. To be sanctified. . . . Hallowed be thy name . . . Juan died today, j ?Donde ira? He was a good man; Muy Macho, Muy Chicano, Pero, I did not see The chariots come for him Nor did I hear the trumpets blare. The only salute I heard Was the wailing sobs of Dona Maria, Y de el padre cuando dijo, "Holy Mary, Mother of God, Pray for us now and at the hour of our death amen.*â€™ Pero era un hombre bueno. Holy Mary, Mother of God, Blessed art thou amongst women And blessed is the fruit of thy womb Jesus. ?Donde esta mi hijo? Ya nacio, ?que no? He is to be blessed by Good, But, es Chicano Y el Chicano sabe Que no hay bueno. Solo en joventud. Where is my son, Maria? Where is he gone? Como puede estar en los cielos Cuando the earth Has eaten him whole? . . . Thy Kingdom come. Thy will be done Arturo Sylvano Bobian Reprinted from Publications
