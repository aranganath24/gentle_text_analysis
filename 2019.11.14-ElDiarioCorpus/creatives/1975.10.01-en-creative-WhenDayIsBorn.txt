WHEN DAY IS BORNWhen day is born I say: what fortune to be a witness of the end of the dark night that has given my Country so much pain and bitter. And there I see man rise, grow and become a giant. When day is born I can feel your love grow with time, while your hand caresses my hair, while you give me pain and consolation. When day is born I tell my two children to carry light in their eyes, to illuminate with abundant hope both work and bread. When day is born I think about the six o'clock gathering in the center, with all the people around shouting and defending that which they had conquered.
