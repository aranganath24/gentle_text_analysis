AZTLAN
Aztltin te siento en mi corazon te veo par lox ojos mios ahora nomas son sueinos. Pero AZTLAN con cad a dia que pasa el dolor en mi corazon crece, just to see you exist in front of me no longer a vision, but a reality. All of the fables, cities of Hold, fountains of youth; AZTLAN a city of fountains not of youth but of beauty, of pure water. A city of ho Id not in ore but of the purity of love, the love of one brown man for another. AZTLAN a city of bronze people, golden brown a shade of skin that everyone in our turmoiled world is try inn to acquire, no you can't sun it and if you did I know your heart is not of my bronze love. A race deprived of societies riches, wealth and fortune. A race scorned. tormented, ridiculed, enslaved and robbed for nearly two centuries. A conquered race we are told, but yet not lost. And better still we know we are not yet defeated. A proud, race never losin faith never losin color. AZTLAN re esperu!!!! JOSE'
