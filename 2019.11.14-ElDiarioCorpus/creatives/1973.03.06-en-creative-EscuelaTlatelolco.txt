ESCUELA TLATELOLCO ESCUELA TLATELOLCO has met with a CRISIS. The boiler/furnace of the Escuela has been damaged beyond repair and is obsolete, therefore, it will have to be replaced at the cost of at least $20,000.00. Presently, school time will have to be made up on Saturdays and Sundays for the days lost due to cold weather, cold rooms, no furnace and fear for our children getting sick. Preparations are being made to continue classes at individual’s homes, until the furnace repairs are completed. ESCUELA TLATELOLCO asks you for your Chicano Pledge and ask that you place an order for the Epic Poem “I am Joaquin” from the Escuela’s Aztlan Bookstore, 1567 Downing Street, Denver, Colorado 80218. fti m in K “I am Joaquin” “I am Joaquin was the first work of poetry to be published by Chicanos for Chicanos and is the forerunner of the Chicano cultural renaissance . . . The sounds of movement, the literary and anthropological quest for our roots, the renewal of a fierce pride and tribal unity, are the reasons why I Am Joaquin had to be shared with all my hermanos y bermanas, fathers, mothers, and grandparents. Their time, and now our time, could not be left behind and forgotten." Rodolpho Gonzales.
