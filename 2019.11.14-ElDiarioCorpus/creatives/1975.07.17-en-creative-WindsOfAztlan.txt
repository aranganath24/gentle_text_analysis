WINDS OF AZTLAN Brown souls crushed into anglo anonymity on urban streets, alleyways, corners of the Southwest, Midwest, Northwest and all points East. Preservation of Chicano identity etched in barrio graffiti names written temporarily on the side of a building condemned by Urban Renewal and moved by H. U. D. La sangre llama la raza cosmica. The collective spirit blows in the winds of Aztlan, from the hot deserts of the Southwest to the plains of the Midwest, Northwest and all points East. The spirit defines collectively Chicano/Chicana equality. Moving together, weâ€™ll reach shore AND MAKE WAVES of another history on the bones we bequeath to Chicano posterity. M.T. Gaitan
