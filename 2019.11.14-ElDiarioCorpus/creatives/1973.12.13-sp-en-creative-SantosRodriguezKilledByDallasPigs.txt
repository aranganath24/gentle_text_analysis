SANTOS RODRIGUEZ KILLED BY DALLAS PIGS

Santos Rodriguez, latest member de los ninos heroes, doce anos de vida ayer y hoy ya no eres your killer is a beast without a mother he was aborted by the asfalto americano, not even mother earth would have him. Dallas balas from a magnum blew half your head away while your hands remained handcuffed, the, quote, â€œpolice officer" and not you was the one with a record in two other separate occasions he had killed two blacks also young like you, The department must have, without a doubt, given him some medals for his valor instead of putting him away as they should have. Your asesino was a sick animal, playing a human, playing an officer of the law Join now, santos, the long line of crosses color brown Junior Martinez will teach you how to dance. Ricardo Falcon will share with you his gran coraje Ruben Salazar will teach you how to write our quejas If what happened to you had happened some years back the crime would have gone unnoticed, now, anger instead of tears, a riot instead of oraciones, you, carnalito, are front page stuff in nuestros corazones.
