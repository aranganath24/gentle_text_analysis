Antiperros
Elizondo "Land lost, flame of love Land destroyed; I am full of love" My young brothers, full of life, from pretend defeat arose, to sing with me of pleasure and of pain. All as one, they told to me a tale without a book, written now across the tracks where they the other live in white enamel clinics, that cover the steel of their lost souls. So much they told me,...too much the quantity of filth the others have amassed hills of muck, with green papers, and the retch of fat swear. they say that from here to the neon they have gone to plant Insolence of aseptic foot on silver sands, and a fake rag stiff as death. I Wish these words pure and good as days in truthful poverty young brothers measure what in other ways they know.
