IN THE NAME OF GOOD WILL
The old black shoe was discarded Into the yellow bag For goodwill Industries. The lovely velvet rag That used to be a dress Into the yellow bag went For Goodwill Industries. The owners had refused To use them one more time To save them further abuse. How old is old? How new is new? New gets old And old can get renewed. The three-wheel bike That a little boy would ride Was priced into a box For Goodwill Industries. The Garcia fishing rod That caught its share of fish Into the collection box went For Goodwill Industries. How old is old? How new is new? Who can say? The boy who rode the bike Grew up to be a man. Had no more use for it When killed in a far-off land. The Garcia fishing rod No longer brings joy For the man who used it No longer has a little boy To share it with All in the name of Good Will.
