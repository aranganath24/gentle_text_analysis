RINCHE
(A Bigoted Poem by a Bigoted Person about a Bigoted Man) The Texas Ranger rode straight and true All through the night In search of the “meskin" desperado To squelch his might. When he found a campfire’s glow. His heart thumped with delight For now he would get his prey. Possibly without a fight. He sneaked into the camp With the stealth of a cat, But his intentions and thoughts Were those of a rat. He drew his trusty Colt And fired into the slumbering victim. And a wide grin crossed His weathered face as he kicked 'im. Then a look of surprise came Upon the good Ranger’s face For this was not the man That he was to chase. As he mounted his trusty steed And rode off into the horizon. He thought, “No harm done. He was only another Mexican.” "Once again. Good and Justice Have triumphed.” Gerald Tafoya
