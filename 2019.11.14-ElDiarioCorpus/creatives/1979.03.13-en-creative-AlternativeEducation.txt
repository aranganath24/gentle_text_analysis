“Our school is completely different! and the concept of schools that is had here in the United States is completely different than the concept of schools among Indian people. Our school does not have facilities or buildings. Our school is nature... it Is the fields ... it is the woods... it is the stars... it is the sky... We have some students and we study with them, together we are all students and we are all teachers. We are students of those who know more and we are teachers of those who know less. In our schools the teachers’ knowledge is not imposed on the students, and we make no annual examinations... In these schools the student is answered and instructed only what he wants to know, and in that way they learn more and quicker. This is the way the old ones taught... and this is the way we are teaching in our schools. There we call it... the Kalpulli of Koacalko.” Tlakaelel “This is our message.” Kalpulli Koacalko, A.C.
