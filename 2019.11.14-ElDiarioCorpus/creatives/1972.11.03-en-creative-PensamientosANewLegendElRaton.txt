A NEW LEGEND! EL RATON
I was walking down the street in a town called Nowsville, Siberia. It seemed to be very quiet at the time, when all of a sudden I heard a rat munching on some goat cheese. Now what would a rat be doing eating hard goat cheese near a wine bottle at about four fifteen and a half in the morning? I walked up to this rat and I said, “Scat, rat.” He said “Why don’t you blow, bro.” We got into a heavy rap about how old he was and where he came from. All he said was I should mind my own business. I started to cry and said to
myself, “That cat, I mean rat, just called me a blow bro, or, I should say, he said, ‘Why don’t you blow, bro." I said to myself, “Bummer, bummer.” So I picked him up by his left foot and said, “Listen here, you rat. Don’t ever call me down like that,” and he said, “Bueno, Bro.” 1 asked the rat, “Where can I find a place to sleep?” He said, “There’s a town fifteen miles north northeast of here.” I said, “What is the name of this town?” And the rat said,“l don’t know, bro.” So I told the rat, “It was nice meeting you, rat,” and all he did was bite me on my left knee and ran away.
