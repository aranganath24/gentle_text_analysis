A WARRIOR IN CHAINS 
When u warriors Spirit is whole and strong He is not afraid to die It Ã­s of no avail to threaten a warrior with death For death has little meaning To live A warrior needs Freedom - For it is the Indian way To Endure A Warrior needs the right To freedom of thought A warrior takes console in the Sacred Pipe For it is his Religion Like a dying pool Of water A warrior becomes stagnant Without the freedom Of expression For it is The Indian wav A Warrior perishes silently Alone For his people cannot Hear his words Without the freedom Of communication In prison There are Few Human rights My bed has been a concrete Floor My blanket has been my Own blood I survive While those that Abuse me are Honored But I am nourished by the Great Spirit Ever true and unwavering I do not feel lost I am not alone and weak My principles remain Steadfast My beliefs remain the Indian Way
