CriticismDear Sir: I just recently read the recent issue of El Diario de la Gente, vol. 5, number 4 and was shocked at the lack of professionalism by the writers and staff. No wonder Chicanos have a bad name when, in the name of our brothers and sisters, you publish so many lies, halftruths, and innuendo. Mixed with some truth, it is an effective propaganda sheet at best. In fact, it appears as if the Crusade for Justice writes your paper for you. Your paper is full of accusations of racism, yet the paper itself is probably one of the most racist attempts at dividing and separating our people from the anglo that 1 have ever seen. What human being in this world does not want to be accepted for him or herself and accepted fully. You do not heal, you wound, hurt, and create hatred. We all know that the bombs carried by Los Siete de Boulder were in the cars because those involved decided that the way to end oppression was to oppress. Yet we repeatedly lie to ourselves and our brothers and sisters by claiming these individuals as martyrs. Why do we make heros of those in our society who sow their own form of hatred. I for one choose the tough road loving and forgiving. It is too easy to hate, to lie, to choose to believe the worst and to see only the evil in people. It is also an ugly way to spend the short 40 or 50 years we have left, you and I. I have but one suggestion for you if you would speak for the Chicano community anywhere. Work a bit harder at the truth the total truth. Not just our side of the truth. One who tries to be honest no matter how much it hurts.
