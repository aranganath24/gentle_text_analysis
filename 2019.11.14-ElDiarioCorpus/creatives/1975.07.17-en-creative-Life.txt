LIFE
1 have watched you, Life flying on the wings of youth, a restless spirit, racing time for time might run too fast, I have seen you a careless boy for time has not taught you danger, I have seen you a selfless child for time has not taught you greed, I have seen you a happy child for time has not taught you pain.
I have known you, Life old and grey, bent with the burden of years,, content to sit and let youth rule, I have listened to you as you expound the wisdom of ages as you decry the cruelty of man, and exalt the goodness of God. I have seen your sparkling eyes as they reflect the good times. I have seen the mist in them as they recall the ache of love. I have known you, Life.
