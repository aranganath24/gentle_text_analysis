WIND OF THE PEOPLEThey still want to stain my land with workers' blood those who talk of freedom and have black hands. Those who want to separate \ mothers from their sons and want to reconstruct the cross to drag Christ. They want to hide the shame they have dispersed for centuries but the color of assassins cannot be cancelled from their faces. They are in thousands those who have offered their blood and in multitudes have multiplied the loaves of bread Now I want to live, together with my son and my brother, a springtime for everybody we are building day by day, The threat of the masters of misery does not frighten me the star of hope continues to be ours. Wind of the people they call me, wind of the people they bring to me, they scatter my heart and blow on my throat. Thus the poet will sing until his heart resounds along the paths of the people now and forever.
