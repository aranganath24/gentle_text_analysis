The organizer
Abelardo Delgado "And the flock shall be one" The job that should be done Was not issued by The U.S. government But by a gent full of and full of obscure ideas A classless society idea Is full of the same massage, One flock, And can you Imagine Anything sillier That buddhism crossed up With Christianity And catholics sharing' a bed with protestants and agnostics And atheists eating off The same plate With believers And yes What is even more beautiful Is the gathering On the same floor
Of whores and homosexuals Sadists, nymphos, masochists, Thieves, adulterers and murderers With saints, How does that strike you? A flock E pluribus unum The Jig saw puzzle God Fulfilled by us salmons upstream bound Who having never been lost cannot be found.
Abelardo (Lalo) Delgado's poems are from the book, Aztlan, An Anthology of Mexican American Literature, edited by Luis Valdez and Stan Steiner. The book is available through Random House, Inc., N.Y.
