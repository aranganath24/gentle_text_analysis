As time passes ever so quickly people tend to lose their sense of direction. Their plight at one time changes to a different faction or they lose their initiative all together. This principle also applies to the Chicano movement. The Chicano movement started out with a philosophy of nationalism i.e. the advancement of our people. Over the past decade this idea has changed to individualism. We no longer think of our people and their needs but only of our selfish wants and desires. This is also applicable to the Chicano people here on the Boulder campus. We have forgotten our past, the struggle that it took to bring Chicanos to this campus. We now think only of our plight through school and to hell with anything else that might stand in our way.This attitude will bring us to our end because without participation from members of our Chicano community our organization is sure to flop. Our movement is only as strong as the people behind it. When it dies, we die.
