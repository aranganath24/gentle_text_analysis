Harvard Graduates
Ah. those clever Harvard graduates Who thought their hipocracy Was just their wise ass name and that was all Faultlessly perfect (mother knows) Impeccable manners (granny Knows) Immaculate appearances would seem to show Inner security, selfless maturity Peer group and status quo Paying each oilier mutual compliments They managed to survive, those magnificent Harvard graduates. Willful arrogance Passing for intelligence (why of course not) ‘Pass me the jello,” one said with perfect Pronunciation And it was passed with equally perfect etiquette Pluck the chicken clean Skimmed the cream “How dare you sir" Being polite is such a pleasant thing Ah. those wise assed guvs with grinning faces Derisive laughter was their pal America was their dream, so it seems But were they really patriots Or just a hunch of pimps.
