Mateskis sour grapesPlans by some dissatisfied Engineering students to secede from ASUC reek with the smell of “sour grapes.” The engineers, a minority themselves, had no complaints and no thoughts of secession when Peter Solomon was ASUC President. After Dennis Mateski blew his credibility on campus, his supporters decided that if “you don’t play it my way. I’m going to take my toys and go home.” "Those people are just pissed off because they lost the election," a high ASUC official said, “to boot, the engineering students receive several times as much money from NDC as they got from Solomon. Secession plans could only hurt student representation, he said, since “ASUC has little enough power now." “People don’t realize that we fund many worthwhile groups, including the Rocky Mtn. Rescue Club and Legal Aid," he said. “Computer cards will never be able to tell students about worthwhile projects, so how will they keep functioning" he asked. The official didn’t think the engineering students would support the plan, mainly because "they trusted Dennis Mateski once before, and I don’t think they’re stupid enough to trust him again," he said.
