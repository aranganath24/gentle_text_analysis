MACHO REFLECTIONS Mirate bien Chicana en tu espejo colgado, Si la reflexion te da La imagen de tu macho Sabras que la realidad La ves por ojos del machista Tus acciones scran concrecion del pensamiento egoista. Rompe tal espejo Chicana o, a la proxima mirada, Veras la fachada de una mascara (o una cascara) Ocultando la !PURA NADA! Does your mirror on the wall Reflect a Chicana view? Or is the image that you see only your macho looking back at you? Realize that your reality Is through his eyes and identity. Your actions and imitations are products of his pride and vanity. Break that mirror Chicana! or the next time that you look. You'll encounter another view A mask of a macho will look back at you, and grin with false pride that itâ€™s hiding NOTHING inside. M.T.
