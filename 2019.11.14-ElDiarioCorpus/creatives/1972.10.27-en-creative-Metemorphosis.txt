METEMORPHOSIS
From the dingy streets of the barrio where one carnal kills another for having crossed his territory. To the tecatos in La Plaza Jarvis lost in their world of the bizarre. Escaping to the ranks of the militants, honored by fast flying bullets and dying brothers and sisters. To the anger of a lost forgotten poet whose poems are like that of a machine gun blasts. To the burning fields of the campesinos chained by the greed of the land lords of America Incorporation. Down the madness of lost alleys of the young disgusted at the never known constant plague of wars that have followed him, his father and grandfather, and will follow each of us to our graves. History raped beauty of the mind as men destroy and build you to their absurd desires. Books that spit at my face uncertain and confused facts. Money which is false and empty as these men who rule this so called free country of the world. Weeping children of the world that twine for survival. Aching heart beats that listen for death’s dark curtain. Unknown sunlight that circles this artificial world provided by Dupont or Kodack. Strange soil, steel empty people without colour, without faces, without your minds slowly marching never asking why. Drained of love, anger, joy and hate. Freedom and revolutions become lifeless as the wallpaper to be used in all federal office buildings as you stupid idot human machines march in. You flash and roll, move and produce your answer from your memory banks carefully selected. How many are there, how many are left? Who will be free or dead
