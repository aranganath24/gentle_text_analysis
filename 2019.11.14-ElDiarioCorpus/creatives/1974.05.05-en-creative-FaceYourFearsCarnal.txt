FACE YOUR FEARS CARNAL Alurista
do not ask of the sun to give no light or ask the moon to hide her skirt of stars do not torment your hearts and tear your faces learn to live with the darkness with the wind face your fears die only once or a thousand times hiding your face covering your ears from the daring songs of your heart hearten your pace into darkness learn to live without asking your god to be kind, gentle and to change you walk the moon will sing brighter
in her skirt of stairs and open your ears the sun will color your heart and open your eyes
