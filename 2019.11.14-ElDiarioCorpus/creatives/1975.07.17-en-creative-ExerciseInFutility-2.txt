I have watched you, Life, sitting on a throne of glory riding atop foaming waves, exultant, exurberant, I have seen you following dreams in search of chance. I have watched you* Life as you delved in scum as you crawled thru gutters in the streets of Time, bewildered, frustrated, I have seen you following hope in search of hope. I have watched you, Life in love with love loving the beauty of a woman and relishing the fragrance of her body, 1 have seen you emitting love as tho it were a river flowing from your heart 1 have seen you. Life engulfed in the despair of aloneness I have heard your heart cry out for companionship, I have passed you as you walked along a desert path without water for your thirst, I have walked with you on barren land without beast to slay nor trees with fruit to quell the rumble in your belly, I have seen you. Life looking for a friend. And this is what we said. Published by Trucha
