A mad man
Raymundo "Tlgre" Perez Silent, unseen world that revolves within me, No sound, no Joy that the living depart from the dead, Call of the wild, call of the mind Pressed between fantasy and reality Walking toward the horizon, the living dead Panorama that surrounds lays so still, Unseen abyss that lures everywhere and nowhere, Try to cry, try to escape, but it's no use Nor tears or hope can be seen Walk over this weird Joke, knowing there's no ern Look and see no one, hear no one In the midst of a fanatic crowd Hear nothing and see everything fall Inside the walls, Here I stand looking out, no one knows what I see or think about, Which I leave for you to reason or doubt...
