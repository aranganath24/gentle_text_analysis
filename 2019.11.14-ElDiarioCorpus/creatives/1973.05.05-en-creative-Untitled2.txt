UntitledHow often must man search? Why must he think not? It is a fact to be reassured... But what about the wages? He must be honest in his search, For no one else will be convinced. No one else to hurt;... or to live with. To search...for what? To convince, to reassure? To hurt or to live with? NoL.To give, To love, and To be loved. Por Alfonso Fuentes
