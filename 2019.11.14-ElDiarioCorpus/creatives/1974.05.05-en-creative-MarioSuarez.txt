Mario Suarez brings us the lighter mood of the barrios. He makes us laugh at the fights, the crazy love of husbands and wives, and the healthy lust of young lovers. He even laughs when we foolishly try to copy the gabacho. He captures the Chicano spirit that jokes and dances, even in the face of sorrow.
