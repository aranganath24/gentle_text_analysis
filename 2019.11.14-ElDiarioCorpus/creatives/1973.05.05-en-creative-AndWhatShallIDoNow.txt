AND WHAT SHALL I DO NOWand what shall I do now asks the wrinkles on the woman’s face chasing with her distant look her mind. and what shall i do now asks the cleanly shaved, gum chewing man from his wheel chair and sandaled feet. now that the four walls in this nursing home as well as the roommate are foreign, the manager, the nurse, the cleaning woman all strangers they don’t even speak Spanish. i want my veladoras and my san martin, my yerbas y mis plantitas, y mis canarios, my god why did my sons and daughters and grandchildren do this to me and what shall i do now the open mouth half sleep white trensas asks but to whom is a better question yet. the food tastes not like my tasty tortillas y caldito and mis atolitos the tv in color is fine but mis novelas, what happened to my novelas on the mexican channel and what shall i do now asks the woman from her bed, now that I cannot do anything ...wait for death to tie the string?
