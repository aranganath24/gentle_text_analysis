SEE THE FUNNY U.S. GOVERNMENT WORK 
at an s.r.s. proposal writing seminar i reaffirmed how stupidly funny we are and thought i would share el chiste con nuestros viejitos... there are some groovy ideals which have been by congress legislated for which there are, of course, no allocations while there are plenty of allocations for programs for which there is no legislation to help viejitos naturally, see the funny u.s. government work, there too a new department to prevent unwed mothers from becoming pregnant... like putting the panza before the cart, i guess, and while the nutritional value of food goes up so do the prices. see the funny u.s. government work. but to really add insult to injuries all those in the seminar returned to their dallas and Washington offices to find nixon had closed them all together after he had vetoed aid to crippled children, see the funny u.s. government work. abelardo
