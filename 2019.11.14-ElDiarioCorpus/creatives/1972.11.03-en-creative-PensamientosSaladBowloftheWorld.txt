THE SALAD BOWL OF THE WORLD
America is often referred to as the melting pot of the world. | think that this is a wrong title to put on America. It should be the salad bowl of the world. The term, melting pot, means that America is a blending of different cultures races, customs, beliefs all stirred up and blended together to form one country that lives in harmony. Bullwinkle. How can different races live together, still hold their customs, beliefs, and cultural heritage, and live in harmony as one people? The only way would be if everybody gave up the very things that make them a race. In a salad you have different things mixed up, but still whole, still identifiable. Like, say, olives for Blacks, tomatoes for Indians, lemons for Chinese, bleached mushrooms for Whites, and golden, crisp, delicious apples baked juicy brown or Chicanos, all having different flavors like races with their different vibrations about life. In America today you have Blacks, Chinese, Indians, and Chicanos all fighting for their self-concept their lost culture. Nobody wants to be melted into something he can’t identify with. Tony Gandara
