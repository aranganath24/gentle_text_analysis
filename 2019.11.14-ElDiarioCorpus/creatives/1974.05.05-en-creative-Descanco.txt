Descanco
Elizondo In another time after Eleven-Cane, Quetzalcoatl went riding through the rounded hills, breasts of Califas, from San Diego to Sonoma. They were stealing water from the wells of others, and putting wire fences on the lands. I said nothing to them; all I did was watch. If they were my own people I would do them harm, but they are not. They are children and slaves of gold, worse yet; with Winchester carbines clouds of smoke resound in chorus. I was born in nineteen; in time my body became earth. Every so many years I'm born again; in the fruit of the fields my brothers caress me cutting grapes, picking tomatoes, moving the rocks off the track. In sweet waters of my Califas and Valley of the Rio Grande the irrigators let me pass, to wet the earth. In hard air of the desert, with its sun so hot, I hurl myself. I will live as long as there are Chicanos.
