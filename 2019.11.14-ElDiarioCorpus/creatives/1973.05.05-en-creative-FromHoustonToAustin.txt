FROM HOUSTON TO AUSTINwith one more little shove i could return to myself i could very easily become the prodigal son in some strange airport it is also quite possible that with a little bitty shove i could fall forever into nothingness and it could be all right too since i am already nothingness... cream and sugar and stereo music and coffee, today i played jesus christ tomorrow i play judas. abelardo
