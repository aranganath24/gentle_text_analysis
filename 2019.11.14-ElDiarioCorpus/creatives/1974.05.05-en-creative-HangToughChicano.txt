Hang tough, Chicano
there is still a little chicano in your eyes and an unsung ranchera forgotten on your lips.... there is still the ghost of memories—azteca, maya, pueblo, navajo, apachi zapata, murieta, el chante, tus padres somewhere inside of you, your blood, your heart, your soul but the gringo ways, the gringo pesos are coiling about your guts like a snake burying its fangs deep into the self, the will.... chicano don’t weaken on me don't die on me for i must weep sorrowful tears for you i would be that much less myself without you chicanos, hang tough —por Ricardo Mora
