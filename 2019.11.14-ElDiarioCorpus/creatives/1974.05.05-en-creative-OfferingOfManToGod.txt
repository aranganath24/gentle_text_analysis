Offering of man to God
Alberto Alurista offering of man to god unwind unwind unwind the chord the binding breath of earth of our umbilical history unwind unwind unwind the mind that triggered shots to kill and rape the path, bleeding heart gasping into wilderness and sand a sun to see bum our fears away and bake our faith unwind unwind unwind your heart into a trunk that offers music to the spirit and the woman of red flowers offers melodies that trickle upwards to the flat topped pair of wings that flap, flap, flap, flying to the cloudy pillows of a dream of winds that wind around and upwards to the sun
