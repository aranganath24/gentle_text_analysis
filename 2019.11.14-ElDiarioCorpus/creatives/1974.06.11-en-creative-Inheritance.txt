Inheritance — for Neva Romero
This was once beautiful Boulder Blessed of the Earth with laughing waters of sparkling mountain streams Steep slopes of the Flatirons eternal memory of great upheavals of the Earth that thrust huge slabs of rock skywards standing as eternal monuments to our sisters and brothers murdered Neva Romero. Reyes Martinez and many more Your memory is written on the snow-capped mountain peaks the deep canyons the open plains Your love of life, your love of all people. La Raza Sprinkles in the swirling waters of the mountain streams.
