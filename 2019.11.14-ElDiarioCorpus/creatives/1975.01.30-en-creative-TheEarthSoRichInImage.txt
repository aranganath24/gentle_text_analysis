The earth so rich in image
and mystique Binds all men from <me bright continent to another And its days are made for life Beyond the curve, the blinding heat Not made to forever wail and yearn But lime to note, the sound, the mountain home, the brook. the roaring hearth The child's hand, the gentle Whisper in the night The red. the black, the gold.
