If you bounce a check and do not make it good within three weeks, you have the opportunity to bring your case to the UCSU executives, one time only, to prove your good intent. IT you clear your debt within one week, your bounced check has not yet been processed, not covered by student fees, and so your credit remains untarnished. This new policy may still seem harsh, but the UCSU check cashing account covers two thousand dollars in bad checks yearly, while the bookstore and finance officer must process and attempt to chase down all those checks. So, in the interests of avoiding total chaos as well as bankruptcy, we are continuing this past policy with the addition of a limited, one time clemency clause. As usual, we will try to answer your friendly and/or irate questions in UMC 334. UNIVERSITY OF COLORADO STUDENT UNION
