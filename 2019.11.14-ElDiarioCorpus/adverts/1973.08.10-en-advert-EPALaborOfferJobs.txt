EPA, labor offer jobs

A contract between the U. S. Department of Labor and the Environmental Protection 
Agency (EPA) has resulted in funding for environmental cleanup jobs for training 2,200 
jobless or underemployed persons in 39 states. Training and funding for Colorado 
include 80 positions, totaling $67,300. Secretary of Labor Peter J.
Brennan has announced that EPA will promote, develop, and subcontract manpower 
programs in 39 states and Puerto Rico to help alleviate the shortage of skilled 
supprofessionals in the environmental pollution control and abatement fields. The one-
year contract calls for at least 40 percent of the trainees to be new hires. Of these, 
nearly half will be Vietnam-era veterans, with special emphasis on disabled veterans. 
Trainees will be recruited through the efforts of employers, mainly municipalities and 
state agencies, and through referral by the local Employment Service offices. On-the-job 
training will be conducted on the work site and trainees will receive regular wages and 
full employee benefits.
