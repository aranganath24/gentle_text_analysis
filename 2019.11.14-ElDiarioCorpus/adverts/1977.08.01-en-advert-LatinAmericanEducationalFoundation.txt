Latin American Educational FoundationThe Latin American Educational Foundation (LAEF) is a non-profit organization founded in 1949 for the purpose of raising funds to provide assistance to Chicano students so that they may continue their education. The Foundation¡¯s biggest challenge through the years has been to increase the amount of monies raised to meet the demands of the increasing number of students. LAEF does not finance any students entire education, however, it has helped many to overcome financial hurdles when the need is the greatest. LAEF has done much to enhance the educational opportunities of Chicano youths in the State of Colorado. As the demand becomes greater, the Foundation must continue to grow in its efforts to meet these demands. The accomplishment of the goal can only be achieved by your financial and moral support. The LAEF depends on voluntary contributions from corporations, foundations, and a variety of organizations and individuals who are concerned with assisting young Chicano students obtain the highest level of education possible.
