Basta! (enough!) Ever heard of the Arizona Cotton Strike of 1020? Or the 1875 fight for bilingual education in Los Angeles’ schools? Los Martires deTexas of 1913 ... the 1936 closing of 1 the Colorado-New Mexico border to Chicanos? These are all important events in Chicano history. But too few Chicanos remember them today. This is because we have been systematically denied knowledge of our own proud history. Chicano History Calendar El Calendario Chicano 1075 traces the long history of the Chicano movement by documenting nearly 400 events from our recent and distant past in a calendar format we can all understand and use. Help destroy the myth of the "sleeping giant!" Spread awareness of our proud Chicano history. Order El Calendario Chicano 1975 for yourself today.
