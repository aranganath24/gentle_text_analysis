# OK -Reflections on China* consists of excerpts from the Political Diary of Comrado Envor Hosha. The notes included in this volume belong to the period 1962-1972. This volume and a second one, which extends to December 1977, were first published and distributed within the Party in January 1978. Now these two volumes are made available to the public in Albanian and foreign languages. In these notes the xigiags of the Chinese leadership, its revisionist, anti-social-ist and anti-Albanian course, are revealed. From these notes and others which may be published later, the reader will be able to see the analysis the PLA has made and the principled stands it has taken in defense of Mariism-Leninism.
