FREE TUTORING UMAS TUTORIAL COMPONENT WILLARD HALL ROOM Cordially invites you to take advantage of free tutorial services offered in all areas of study for all UMAS students. Your hosts are qualified students, both graduate and undergraduate students who are selected for their comprehensive knowledge in their respective areas, as well as their sensitivity to the needs of UMAS students. We have tutors for all subjects. You and your tutor will be able to arrange your own meeting times as often as you may need to meet. It is not good to make last minute arrangements because ‘ cramming with a tutor is as bad as “cramming” by yourself. UMAS Tutorial Staff will assist you as much as possible, but you must come in and request the tutor for yourself. Come in early to contact your tutor. For Reservations please call 492-8317, if you are off-campus, or ext. 8317, if you reside on campus. AVAILABLE!
