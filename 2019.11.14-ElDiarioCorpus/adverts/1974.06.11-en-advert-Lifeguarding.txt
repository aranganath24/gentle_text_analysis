LIFEGUARDING IS A GOOD GIG But in order to do it, you have to have the proper training. The recreation department is looking for qualified lifeguards and in order to enable more people to qualify, the Red Cross Senior Lifesaving class is being offered this summer. If you think you qualify for the class, drop by the pool office and pick up the prerequisites and class schedule. You could end up a qualified lifeguard!
