This graphic by Robert Garcia depicts the many phases of political struggle UMAS has endured over the past years.
The original painting was done for the "Ten Years of Struggle" commemoration which was held in 1979 dedicated to Los Seis. The graphic illustrates the indigenous Aztec culture of Chicano people, as well as the European influence over the past 460 years.
