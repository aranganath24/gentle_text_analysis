Veronica... The officers expect us to treat them with respect although we are not allowed to receive any or very little in return. Many times we feel like “robots,” told when to eat, when to sleep, we’re told how to live. We’re stripped out of total responsibilities. The matrons strip us of our womanhood by calling us girls and treating us as such. With all this responsibilities being taken away from one, how do you expect us to survive later in the real world? We need your help! Veronica Vigil Joyce Schillo Nancy A. Shape
