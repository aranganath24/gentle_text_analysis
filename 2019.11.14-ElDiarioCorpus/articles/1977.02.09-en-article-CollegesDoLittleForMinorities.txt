Minority college students face a revolving door because colleges do little to keep them on campus after enrollment, and because of past discrimination at lower level schools, says HEWS civil rights chief Martin Gerry. In a sworn deposition to a United States District Court Gerry said, The fact is minority college enrollment has not been translated into practices which effect treatment. The plans have inadequately addressed retention and that is crucial, he said. Gerrys testimony resulted in a court order to the Department of Health, Education and Welfare to work out guidelines within 45 days for the desegregation of college systems in six southern states. Gerry, who will be resigning as director of HEWS Office for Civil Right earlier charged that Chicanos and Blacks had recieved bad education and were descriminated against in elementary and high schools, often arriving on college campuses in states that "ignored the past which their own schools created.
