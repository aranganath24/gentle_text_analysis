Chicano Mass every Sunday at St. Tomâ€™s
Every Sunday at 12:30 p.m. St. Thomas Aquinas Church, 14th and Aurora in Boulder, offers a Chicano mass with the entire celebration in Spanish. The mass was begun at the urging of Chicano students, staff and faculty at the university, and with the help of Father Tony Gutierrez and Sister Betty Edl.
All Chicanos from the area are urged to attend the mass and join in the celebration.
