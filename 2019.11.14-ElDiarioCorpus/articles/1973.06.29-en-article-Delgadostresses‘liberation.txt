Delgado stresses ‘liberation’

“The most beautiful liberation is the liberation of our minds; our minds are not free,” Chicano poet and philosopher Abelardo “Lalo” Delgado told a crowd of UMAS students and staff last week. Delgado was a guest speaker at the University last week as part of a cultural awareness program initiated by UMAS to bring various speakers to the University to speak to the UMAS-EOP summer students. Various speakers will speak each Wednesday afternoon during the summer session. Delgado related our responsibility to criticize America to an old constitution that needs to be reupholstered in reaching our goals of creating a real Aztlan. “The system makes you choose a nasty one way street”, he said. If the system is the one who does this to us, it is our enemy; we must destroy this system,” Delgado said. Outlining several overtones to the audience, Delgado reminded all students and new incoming freshmen students in the summer program, that “You are entering an institution whose aim is to oppress people. The White American system brainwashes people, but we need more Chicanos emerging from our educational institutions as technicians”, he said. “We need carnales who are crazy enough to dream new things," he said, “and everybody who has more talents should share them with more people.” “I do not believe in intimidating Chicanos into being Chicanos." he said. “Instead Chicanos should help other Chicanos to see the light." Delgado continued to speak of the inequities and injustices of the American system. He recited one of his many poems for which he is known.
