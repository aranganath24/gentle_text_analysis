Student organizationAlthough UMAS-EOP and the UMAS organization deal with the same program there is a difference between the two. For example, UMAS-EOP conducts business at the administration level whereas the UMAS organization which is made up of students, deals with business at the student level. The governing body of the organization is the Board of Directors consisting of five atlarge seats, five permanent components (Macho, art component, El Diario, Farm Labor Task Force and the entertainment component) and a Chairman and Vice-Chairman. Members of the board are selected from within the student body of UMAS by an election. Although the board is a decision making body, major issues are taken to the UMAS student body which meets every two weeks. The Board of Directors is only a small part of the organization.The major part is made up of any and all UMAS students that give a damn about what comes down on this campus and the way it affects their Chicano brothers and sisters, Chicanos that have come- to the realization that the only way we're going to maintain a Chicano program on this campus is to get off our asses and keep the man on his toes. We would be fools if we depended on the administration pigs of this campus to run our program, if we did Chicanos would vanish ffom CU. It's our duty as Chicanos to build and strenghthen our program for the Chicanitos and Chicanitas, yet to come. Right now there are a lot of good leaders within the "machine'' but they won't be here forever, that leaves it up to you as a new student. Sin Mas Mike Carreras Chairman, UMAS board of directors
