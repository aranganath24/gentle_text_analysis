New Assistant Dean Appointed
Ms. Ruth Casarez has accepted an offer to become the new Assistant Dean at the University of Colorado Law School. MS. Casarez will replace Tom Trujillo, who resigned several months ago to take a similar post in North Carolina. The choice was made after several persons were interviewed for the position including many from the Boulder community. By replacing Mr. Trujillo, Ms. Casarez will be the only minority person in the Law School’s administration. The new Assistant Dean is originally from Austin, Texas and graduated from the University of Texas. She taught junior high school before entering the Law School at Denver University. Since graduating, she has worked in the clinical education program at D.U., served as a Deputy Attorney General for the state of Colorado and as a staff attorney for the Legal Aid Society of Metropolitan Denver.
