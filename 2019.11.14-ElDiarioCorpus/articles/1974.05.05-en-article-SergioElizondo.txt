Sergio Elizondo's works are taken from his book Perros y Antiperros, una Epica Chicana and is available through Quinto Sol Publications, Inc., P.O. Box 9275, Berkeley, California 94709. Elizando speaks of nature. A voice of the Indio and the Chicano, he looks in disgust at the sterile American world of enamel and artificial money—cheap paper to feed the sweating hogs of greed. Elizando proclaims the victory of the Chicano spirit. We are sons of the earth and cannot be destroyed anymore than our mother.
