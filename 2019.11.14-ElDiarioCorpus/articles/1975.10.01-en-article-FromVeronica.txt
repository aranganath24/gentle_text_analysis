From Veronica..Chicanos, Although many a times the philosophy and the rhetoric becomes anitquated, if not repitious, at this point I think it is essential to contact the outside world. I strongly believe “Los Seis” were eliminated by the white men. regardless of the white men's theory that a faction of the Chicano Movimiento killed our beloved hermanas y hermanos or their other absurd theory. I know for a fact that America is an "unjust country,” with its ill-conceivable myth called the constitution. If “true laws” existed I would not have been incarcerated. I state this with many reasons: I will simply elaborate on one. The moment I refused to cooperate with Bob Bishop, the federal Pig Investigator, he within 24 hours aquired a subpoena. And yet the farce lawpurports that the F. 8.1. has "no” subpoena power. But yet I was subpoenaed and wheeled before the Federal Grand Jury simply because I refused to "cooperate” with the white man's agency called the F. 8.1. Thus, the F. 8.1. is manipulating the Federal Grand Jury for their own utilization. I was asked to elaborate on the treatment here. What can 1 say simply that an inmate is striped with the exception of one’s mind. To the Chicano Revolutionaries I say if you don’t plan on being Incarcerated or plan on dying "por la causa” don’t even place a toe in the door of the Revolution. "If it’s a true revolution you triumph or die”—Che "Los Seis viven en espiritu.” Con Amor Revolutionaries De La Carcel Veronica Vigil
