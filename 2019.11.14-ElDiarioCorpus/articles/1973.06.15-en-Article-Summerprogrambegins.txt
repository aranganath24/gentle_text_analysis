Classes start Monday Summer program begins

The 1973 UMAS-EOP Summer Program is designed to acquaint Chicano students with the University and grant them the opportunity to further their education in an institution of higher learning. The summer program is designed primarily for low income Chicano students and is required of all new EOP entering college freshmen. Approximately 350 Chicano students will be attending the program this year, with classes beginning Monday, June 18. UMAS-EOP director Joe Franco said there will be some changes in the internal structure of the program at different levels, such as basic and advanced courses, in addition to various elective courses the students may take on Wednesday. Franco has said, "Our plans are to develop a summer program to fit the student rather than a program that the student fits. We will continue to stress the academic aspect," he said. Put of the 26 students who got below a 2.0 average last summer, 22 of them made it all the way this year, Franco said. The students will receive a maximum of 11 credit hours during the summer. They will be taking requirement courses such as English, Math, Reading and Language-Social Culture class. In contrast to past summer programs when students were required to all take the same courses, various courses will be offered as electives in addition to the requirement courses. These include Physics, Chicano literature, Mexican Dancing and Recreation. Wednesday afternoons will be reserved for various Chicano speakers and other Chicano related cultural activities. Various recreational activities are also planned.
