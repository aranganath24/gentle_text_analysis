Coors complaint

In recent action, the U.S. Supreme Court has granted the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) their request to investigate charges against the Adolph Coors Brewing Company in Golden, Colorado. Chicanos have boycotted the Coors Brewery and its products for the last five years. The company has been accused of unfair labor practices in their hiring of minorities, including discrimination against Chicano. In 1969, the EEOC filed charges against Coors claiming that the Coors Brewery had violated the 1964 Civil Rights Act by discriminating against minorities in their hiring and placement of jobs at the company. Coors has fought back and maintains that the charge is not based on facts. Coors Filed a suit in U.S. District Court in Denver in an effort to prevent the EEOC from reviewing its hiring records and from interviewing officials of the Coors Brewery. However, the courts have now ruled in favor of the EEOC investigation. According to Paul Gonzales of the American G.I. Forum and Chairman of the Coors Boycott Committee, there have been no further developments since the Supreme Court's favorable ruling a few months ago. Clarence Ayoya, EEOC supervisor in charge of Colorado investigations, said the EEOC has not actually begun the investigation into Coors records, and until such time, all information is confidential. If Coors is found guilty of the charge, the courts will release the information to the public.
