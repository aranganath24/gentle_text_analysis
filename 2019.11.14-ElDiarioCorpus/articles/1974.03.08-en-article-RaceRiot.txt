Race riotWhat the Boulder Daily Camera called a “possible race riot” almost occurred at the International House of Pancakes on Feb. 17 at about 2 a.m. However, the incident was just an example of Boulder anti-Chicano feelings and police overreaction. Andy Salazar and Pete Romero, two students, were waiting to be seated and began a conversation. Five other Chicanos who had just entered the Pancake House began getting acquainted with Salazar and Romero. The group who had been waiting finally asked to be seated. Salazar and Romero, who had entered the Pancake House before the five Chicanos, had been asked to sit with them because of lack of space and also because they had been waiting to be served for 10-15 minutes. They had not even received a menu or water. The Chicanos were waiting to receive menus. When they asked to be served, a waitress refused and asked the Chicanos to leave. When the Chicanos refused to leave, the waitress threatened to call the police. The police responded in force, with 11 officers and police dogs. The officers frisked Salazar and found nothing. However, the officers ordered the entire group of Chicanos to leave. Salazar has filed a complaint with the Human Rights Office of the City of Boulder. Also, the Chicanos involved are considering a complaint or suit against the Pancake House, so that "people can be aware of their type of hospitality.”
