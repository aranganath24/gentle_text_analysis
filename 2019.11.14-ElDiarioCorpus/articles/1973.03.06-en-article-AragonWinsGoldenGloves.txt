Aragon wins Golden Gloves
Ben Aragon, a University UMAS student, captured the championship title in the 147 lb. novice division of the Colorado Golden Gloves State Boxing Tournament in Denver last week. “I was never so happy in my whole life as I was after the finals,” Aragon said after winning an unanimous decision at the end of three rounds against Reggie Duke from the 20th St. Recreation in Denver. Aragon scored a technical knock-out (TKO) in the first round of the preliminaries, which then took him to victory by decision at the end of three rounds in the semi-finals and finals. Aragon had been training for the Golden Gloves for nearly a year, running approximately 10 miles every day and working out at least two hours every day. “My goal was to win . My next goal is getting ready for next year, where I hope to box again, at a heavier weight. It’s good self defense,” he said. A native of Las Cruces, N.M., Aragon once won another Golden Gloves championship in New Mexico when he was nine years old in the 160 ib. division. “I was heavier then than lam now,” he said. Aragon, after moving to Denver three years ago decided to try for the Golden Gloves championship. He began working out his own individual program of conditioning by running, sparring, and exercising. “My education comes first before boxing, though," he said. He is a second semester freshman at this university majoring in Spanish. He is currently active as a member of the Brown Berets from Westminister. Aragon will be participating in other boxing tournaments in Denver in March. He hopes to be sponsored again by the Elks Club who sponsored him in the Golden Gloves. In addition to Aragon, a number of other Chicanos scored in the Golden Gloves tournament. Chicanos from the Denver based Crusade for Justice took runner-up honors and several victories by unamimous decisions.
