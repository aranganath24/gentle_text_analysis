Search committee formedAs yet unknown to most interested students is the fact that a search committee has been appointed by University President Frederick Thieme to aid in finding a Oean for Minority Affairs, a position which seems to have been generally accepted instead of a Vice-President for Minority Affairs. The search committee now consists of five directors of Educational Opportunity Programs plus two faculty members and an administrative person. However, there will be student input into the search committee, according to Joe Franco, UMAS-EOP director, as members of the minority coalition decided. The search committee will review all resumes for the position, and will then narrow the choice down to a group of six or eight candidates. Applications will be accepted until the end of March. El Diario will follow the selection process as closely as possible to insure some measure of Chicano input into the decision, but the burden for assuring a Dean who will be responsible to minority students rests with all of us. You cannot sit idly by and watch as a disinterested spectator while President Thieme appoints a Ògood boy," for this. Dean will be largely responsible for how our programs succeed or fail. If you know of someone who might fill the job requirements, tell him or her to submit a resume to the search committee. Also, follow the actions of the search committee closely, and make sure that your voice is heard during the proceedings. We will do this because our entire familia will be affected by whoever is selected for the Dean of Minority Affairs at the University.
