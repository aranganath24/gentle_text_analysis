US’ to make police states
An AFL-CIO publication says “S-1 is a monstrosity, there is no way to keep this country from going fascist except fighting fascism.” A United Steel Workers publication says the bill needs to be killed, “for under the protection of law the dark days of the Nixon years could return again with disastrous consequences.” In Denver, an organization to educate the various communities has been formed. The West Side citizens to stop S-1 is currently informing citizens as to the ramifications of S-1. The group is stressing an understanding of the bill along with signed petitions which will be presented to the Denver City Council. Mestizo newspaper asserts that, “Revisionist’s call to concentrate on lobbying efforts converts the people’s movement into a tail for the liberal monopolists and into a cheering squad for the Kennedy faction. The decisive battles against the S-1 bill, and against the whole fascist threat, will have to be fought in the factories, streets and communities.” If the means to stop the S-1 Bill fall, the bill will become an invitation to a national revolution, with all urged to attend, strikes is not to force corporations to pay fair wages but rather to outlaw the major means of self defense of the working class. Their . answer to political corruption is not to expose and prevent it but rather to allow and hide it. Their answer to crime is not to correct the root cause of crime, but rather to lock up mass numbers of Chicanos and Blacks. The bill is being condemned throughout the country, and because it is an election year, one-time supporters of the bill have changed their stand on the issue.
