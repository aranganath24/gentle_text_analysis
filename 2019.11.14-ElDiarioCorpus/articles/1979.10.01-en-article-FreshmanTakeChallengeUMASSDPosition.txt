Freshman takes challenge of UMAS student director position
The United Mexican Students at the University of Colorado, Boulder, have recently elected Erlinda Leyba as the new student director for the 1979-80 academic school year. Elections were held on Oct. 3, 1979 with Erlinda winning by a slim six-vote margin over Nick Trujillo. Formally a native of Las Vegas, Erlinda has expressed deep concern for the preservation and advancement of Chicano students on campus. She said, “It’s discouraging to know that many of our fellow Chicano students are dropping out of school because of the constant hassles brought down upon us by this institution.” “1 believe more personal interaction is necessary to rid apathy amongst our people on campus. During my campaign, I experienced many instances where students were willing to disclose their problems; especially with concern to financial aid.” She elaborated on her willingness to explore the inconsistencies of the financial aid office to really find out why there are so many problems. Erlinda expressed, that because she was only a freshman, that there is a lot to learn. She also implied that we (Chicano students) must unite to insure the continued education of the Chicano nation.
