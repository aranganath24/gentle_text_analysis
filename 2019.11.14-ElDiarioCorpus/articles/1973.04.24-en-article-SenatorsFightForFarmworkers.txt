Senators fight for farmworkersThe ASUC senate and executive have been involved in a number of activities this spring semester. One of these activities is the lettuce boycott. One of the biggest strides achieved on campus concerning the lettuce boycott is the acquisition of over 2000 signatures in support of the boycott in the dorms. If the boycott goes through, it will be observed throughout the I entire campus and not just the dorms to stay in line with university consistency, see related story.Another of ASUCs activities this spring was getting third year student Eileen Torres appointed to the CEB. It was through ASUC backing and support that she was considered above other entries for the position. She is the first and only Chicano representative on the CEB. Triexecutive Jess Vigil has his own pet project he is working on this spring, the organization of the Colorado Minorities Council."What the council is designed to do,” said Jess, "is to eliminate the autonomy of minority groups across Colorado campuses. Hence, on issues such as disenrollment and freezes on financial aid, support and endorsement on a wide level can be assured." Chicano ASUC personnel are coordinating efforts with the UMAS organization, the Farm Labor Task Force, and the MACHO organization. One project currently being planned is the Cinco de Mayo celebration, which will have total community participation, just as last semesters’ Fiesta de la Gente succeeded. The theme for this semesters' ASUC officials seems to be community awareness, both by more communityoriented events and more interaction between Chicano students and the university community.
