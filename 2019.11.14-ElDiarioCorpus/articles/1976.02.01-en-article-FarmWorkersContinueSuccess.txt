Struggle not overFarm workers continue successNo one needs to be reminded of the last ten years of courageous and determined struggle waged by Cesar Chavez and the United Farmworkers. The campesinos have demonstrated that their strength in spirit and strategy can overcome the wealth and power of even the most racist of the corporate growers who seek to own them. Despite having to take on these corporations and their servants, the U.S. government (with all of it’s repressive machinery in the courts and police departments), the UFW is knocking on victory’s door. Because of the Insurmountable pressure the farmworkers and their brothers and sisters in the cities exerted in the boycotts of head lettuce, grapes and Gallo wines, the growers were forced to submit to a law in California allowing sure and ballot elections, something they vowed never to see happen. During the election process, the familiar grower tactics were use?) to try to break the union. The Chavistas were fired, arrested, evicted from their homes, threatened with death, deported and attacked by reactionary vigilante mobs. Despite the harrassment, the UFW swept the Teamsters out of the fields by almost 3-1 in the first round of elections. Faced with overwhelming defeat at the election polls, the Growers/Teamsters have been successful in killing the new Cal-ALRB the secret ballot election bill. This leaves the farmworkers with but one tool left—to reinstate the boycott, the picketlines, marches, demonstrations, in front of Colorado chain and liquor stores. Despite victorious election results, virtually nothing has changed, the majority of farmworkers still left unprotected in the fields without union contracts. The outcome of the struggle rests in you. There will be a benefit cocktail for the UFW in Boulder in the near futureplace and time to be announced. Remember, the boycott is still on.
