Veronica's spirit unbrokenHonoring her pledge that she will never testify before the second Federal Grand Jury “investigating” the 1974 Boulder bombings, Veronica Vigil has served the first of a possible 47 month sentence in Denver County Jail. After being served a subpoena by the same F. 8.1. agents who the day before asked her to answer some questions, Veronica was held in contempt of court for her refused to testify before the grand jury. Veronica was held in contempt because she would not allow herself to become a tool of the U.S. government even after he court has “granted” her immunity, (a weapon in itself). Veronica has refused to acknowledge this illegal use of the grand jury whose purpose is not to find the murderers of our people but to father information on Chicano activists and organizations. William Kunsler, in a tape recorded message to Veronica, stated that the only way to put an end to the abuse of the grand jury by the United States government is through committed individuals like Veronica who would rather go to jail than to submit to this tool of repression. Veronica’s attorneys are currently seeking a review by the Supreme Court in their effort to free her. The Supreme Court justices will vote on whether or not they will hear her case. If she loses at the Supreme Court level Veronica faces 11 months immediately. If a new grand jury is empaneled she faces an additional 18 months. Altogether she can be held in jail for 47 months. Veronica’s spirit cannot be broken by prison bars, because she has placed her faith, not in the judicial system of the United States, but in her own commitment to the Chicano Movement.
