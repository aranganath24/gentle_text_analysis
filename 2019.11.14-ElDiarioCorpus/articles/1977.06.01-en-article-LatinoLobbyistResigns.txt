The director of the only Latino lobbyist organization in Washington has resigned. Manuel Fierro, Director of El Congreso for the past four and one half yeafs, stated that El Congreso has been operating on a month to month basis sometimes unable to meet its financial obligations and commitments. There is just simply no money to continue operating El Congresos Washington Office, Fierro said. The organization will be kept intact but without a full time Director. Fierro told El Diario that a new Director will probably be chosen within the next month and that there were a few promising prospects to fill the vacancy, but did not want to make any names known at this time. The organization has received its financial backing solely from contributions from Latino organizations and commmunities throughout the United States. It is the first national organization of its kind to be financed in this manner. Among the 27 bills and amendments passed that were sponsored by El Congreso was the Bilingual Bill of 1968, an extension to the voting rights act, which made ballots bilingual for the Spanish speaking in the Southwest, census legislation for Latinos, sponsoring of various health and health related centers, and vocational related bilingual amendments.
