Youths survey the damages of the Escuela Tlatelolco dormitory. One unidentified youth demonstrates how a police grenade launcher could have been used to destroy the wall. Written on the wall is a dedication to Luis “Junior” Martinez, 20, who was killed during the police confrontation, photo by John L. Espinosa. Only hours after the explosion, the police department sent in demolition crews to destroy the evidence. No one was ever charged with the explosion, nor was the cause ever determined.
