Men earn twice as much as women
WASHINGTONThe gap between the earnings of women and men has nearly* doubled since 1955, according to a publication released by the Womens Bureau, Employment Standards Administration, U.S. Department of Labor. In constant dollars, taking inflation into account, the gap increased from $1,911 in 1955 to $3,433 in 1974, according to the report. "The Earnings Gap Between Women and Men reports that among year-round, full-time workers, mens earnings exceed womens by 56 percent in 1955, but by 1974 the differential had increased to 75 percent. The 1974 median earnings of women were $6,772, compared with $11,835 for men. Although women were 32 percent of all year-round, fulltime workders in 1974, they accounted for 63 percent of workers earning between $3,000 and $4,999, and for 58 percent of those earning $5,000 to $6,999. Women
made up only 5 percent of the workers earning $15,000 or more. The publication notes two primary factors which have contributed to the widening gap: the continued concentration of women in low-skilled, low-paying occupations and the dynamic rise in womens labor force participation which has resulted in a larger proportion of women in or near the entry level of jobs. In commenting on the widening earnings gap, Womens Bureau Director Carmen R. Maymi said it indicated that the employement gains women have made recently in securing higher level and better paying positions have not been significant enough to start a trend toward closing the gap. She stressed the need for renewed action to open more training and employment to women in the highpaying professional, technical, managerial, and craft occupations.
