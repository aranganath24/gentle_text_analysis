Preparation for September 16 has begun in Lafayette for the second annual celebration. The Chicano community will conduct several fund raising projects consisting of dances, raffles, a barbeque and marathon bike ride. Primary concentration will focus on the bike marathon. At least 50 bike-riders will ride 30 miles to El Dorado Springs Sunday, August 10 at 8:30 a.m. An approximate goal of $ 1,000 is the anticipated profit of the committee. The money will be used to cover the costs of various activities for the celebration including mariachis, dances, speakers concessions and others. Dan Escalante, co-ordinator for the committee is appealing to the community for cooperation in order to make the celebration a success. “People (mostly young Chicanos) are giving their time and energy to make it happen. This is important for them. This complete learning experience will be an asset to la raza as these people get older in group building and organization." Dan sees a lot of energy flowing among the gente involved in Diez y Seis remarking that these young people are really putting out a lot of energy. He feels that their efforts need to be supported by the whole Chicano community, because if it’s not, it will not be a successful learning experience. The community can give their support by sponsoring the bike riders and volunteering their services for other activities. "Plus, it’s a lot of fun; gente working together." El Diez y Seiz committee needs the support of carnales de Boulder, Longmont, Lafayette y todo Aztlan. If you can help contact Dan Escalante at 665-4845 or 665-3310, or Cecilia Garcia at 665-3310.
