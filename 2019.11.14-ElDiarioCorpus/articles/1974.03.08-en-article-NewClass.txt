New ClassThere's a lot of enthusiasm among the Chicano students on campus about the new addition to the Chicano Studies Courses. Introduction to Chicano Literature (Eng. 230) was proposed for a better understanding of the mind or soul of the Chicano as expressed in our literature. The soul of the Chicano is rooted in the spirit of his Indio and Spanish ancestry. For this reason the course begins with the mythologies of poetry of los Indios and works up to the contemporary Chicano literature. The literature course is instructed by Tom Vallejos who received his masters in English literature at the University of Colorado. Vallejos is originally from Trinidad, Colo. A variety of American authors and poets are introduced and one text Pedro Paramo by Juan Rulfoi, a Mexican author. This story deals with the life and death of Pedro Paramo and his control over the isolated village of Comala. The course is designed to relate to Chicanos because it is about "nuestra raza" and of his everyday struggles.
