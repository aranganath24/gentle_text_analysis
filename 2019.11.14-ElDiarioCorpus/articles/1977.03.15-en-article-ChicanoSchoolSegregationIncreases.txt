A recent report from Catholic University Law Schools Center for National Policy Review, shows segregation of Chicanos in large school systems is on the rise. In Denver 68 per cent of Chicano students are in schools 50 per cent or more minority and in Albuquerque 70 per cent of the Chicano students are in schools with more than half minority population. Figures collected between
1969 and 1975 show "Puerto Rican students have been particularly affected by immigration patterns taking them into the heart of severely segregated rapidly declining central cities. The report also showed the number of Chicanos enrolled in segregated schools rose from 14 per cent to 31 per cent in Chicago and from 21 per cent to 40 per cent in Houston. In the United States the proportion of Chicano children in heavily segregated schools rose from 64 to 68 per cent. Accordingly to William L. Taylor, policy review center director, Its striking how much the phenomenon of segregation has become a big city phenomenon. Cities with big Mexican-American populations in the Southwest tend to be younger and have reached out to encompass more land, relieving some of the segregation pressure, he said.
