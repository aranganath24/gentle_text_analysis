Charges dropped against Vigil in Cong. Gonzales incidentCharges against Jess Vigil, one of the Boulder Four accused of disrupting a congressman’s speech last August have been by the district attorney’s office because of insufficient evidence. The charges came more than four months after Vigil was cleared of similar charges in a University sponsored “Kangaroo court” before the Faculty Disciplinary Committee. Of the remaining three defendants, Jose Calderon will go to trial May 23; Frank Luevano will be tried Feb. 27 and Charles Kohler is to be tried on March 20. Calderon is charged with disrupting a lawful assembly and interference with University staff and students. Luevano and Koehler are charged only with interference Judge Martin Steinberg ruled the disruption statute unconstitutional and the charge was dismissed. The district attorney’s office is appealing that ruling.Since the charges were brought last summer. Vigil has said he was victimized by the University, the district attorney’s office and the speaker, Cong. Henry B. Gonzales of Texas. He said he has been harassed by investigators including the FBI. In a sworn statement, Cong. Gonzales called Vigil an “agent provocateur” who was a contact with political enemies of the congressman from his own district. He said “apparently some of this was engineered and masterminded in San Antonio, my home town, and in Denver, where the explicit instructions that I should not be permitted to walk out alive from Boulder.” Vigil’s only response to Gonzales' accusations is that they are completely unfounded and that the congressman is “apparently paranoid.” The legal hassles have been costly to Vigil and he, even though acquitted, must pay several hundred dollars of legal fees.
