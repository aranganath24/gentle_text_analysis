Mexican oil flows
MEXICO CITY - Specialists who are breaking down and scooping up thousands of oil from a runaway oil well in the Gulf of Mexico said Thursday they haven’t stopped the 30,000 barrel a day flow, but they practically have the slick under control. They have been able to keep the oil 24 miles from shore and away from rich shrimp beds along the nearby coast. The government oil monopoly “Pemex” said floatation beams surround the slick at a distance of 1,500 feet from the blowout. The oil is being skimmed off and pumped into a nearby tanker. Pemex teams are also desintegrating the oil with chemicals. Divers are attempting to repair valves at the base of the well hoping to shut off the flow.
Workers had reached a depth of about 700 feet in efforts to drill a “relief well” on a drilling platform a half mile away. The relief well could eventually siphon off the oil from the blowout if it cannot be shut down. It could take three months to finish according to specialists. Natural gas in the well ignited when sparks from electric motors escaped turning the well into roaring flames on June 3rd. There were no injuries although 63 men aboard the $22 million drilling platform were evacuated. The platform was extensively damaged and towed to safety. The blowout aroused concern about the oil’s effects on marine life and on the beaches in the Gulf. Three stations to test water, sand, and sea life on the coasts and at the mouths of several rivers has been installed by Pemex.
