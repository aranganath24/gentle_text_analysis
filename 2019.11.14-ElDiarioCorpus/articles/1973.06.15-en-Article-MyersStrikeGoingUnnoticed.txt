Myers Strike Going Unnoticed

Strikers at Myers and Company are continuing their efforts to wrest fair conditions from their oppressors, the Coors Brewing Company (see the March 6 El Diario) A march in support of the Myers workers took place March 20th. Some 150 strike supporters marched from the UMC to the Myers plant, but "the plant was shut down two hours early, Joe Murphy, a striking worker, said, "so the scabs would see the community support we have." A call to the Myers office yielded this reply: "I am sorry, but there is no one here you can talk to. The strikers are encountering some difficulty in receiving adequate press coverage of the strike. "Although we had nearly ISU people marching through downtown Boulder, TV and radio totally ignored the event, Murphy said, "and newspaper coverage was limited to the Town and Country Review, with a little mention in the Colorado Daily and The Boulder Daily Camera. Murphy noted that "both the Daily and the Camera grossly underestimated the number of marchers and gave relatively poor coverage of the event." "In fact, the Camera has been running ads asking for strike breakers whenever Myers scab force begins to drop off, Murphy said. One of the main difficulties the strikers are encountering is the reluctancy of the National Labor Relations Board to rule on the striker charge of unfair labor at Myers. "A couple of months apparently means very little to those people considering our case, but to those of us out of work, especially my fellow workers with families to feed, time is extremely important, Murphy said. Another problem is the scabs who continue to cross picket lines. "In the past, Chicanos and Blacks seldom worked at Myers, Murphy said, "but apparently the company, failing to meet Coors production demands, has put aside its past racist hiring policies and is hiring minorities." Murphy said.
