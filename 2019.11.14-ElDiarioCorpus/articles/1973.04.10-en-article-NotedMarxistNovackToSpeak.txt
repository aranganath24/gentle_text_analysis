Noted Marxist Novack to speak“The ultimate goal of socialism," Che said in Socialism and Man in Cuba is, “to see man liberated from his alienation which will provide on the one hand the conditions for greater freedom, and voluntary labor on the other, based on the Marxist concept that man truly achieves his full human condition when he produces without being compelled by the physical necessity of selling himself as a commodity." Tomorrow at 4 p.m. at the UMC Ballroom, Marxist philosopher George Novack will speak on “Socialism and Humanism.” Like Che, Novack is not only a noted Marxist scholar, but a longtime activist as well a rare trait for most philosophers. Novack began his political career on the defense committee of the “Scottsboro Boys,” a group of young Blacks framed for rape in the Thirties. Besides being a prolific writer in the area of Marxist philosophy, Novack has written on economics, the mideast crisis, genocide against American Indians and on the situation in China and Cuba. While the title of his lecture indicates he will deal with “humanism” it will not be the humanism so often pronounced by liberal philosophers today. For Novack, humanism is the liberation of humanity from capitalist oppression. As. he wrote in 1965, he has no time for the morals and “impartiality” of liberals who condemn U.S. terror and the revolutions against it in one breath. “The claim of the pragmatic liberals that their morality is superior to that of the Marxists in theory and practice cannot be sustained. Their ethics lacks a sound scientific basis because it systematically disregards the most fundamental factor in the shaping of social relations and the motivating of individual conduct in modern life the division and conflict of classes The lecture is being sponsored by the YSA and by CEB.
