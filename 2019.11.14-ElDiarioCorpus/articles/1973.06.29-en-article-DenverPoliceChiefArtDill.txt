Denver Police Chief Art Dill and northside Denver resident Santiago Valdez listen to local Chicanos recount grievances against the Denver police force. The residents gathered at La Raza Park, 38th Avenue and Navajo Street, and told Dill of police harassment in enforcing Denver’s 11:00 p.m. curfew. While Dill promised a “police moratorium” and said “some of these complaints are probably justified,” the harassment continued that evening. Two Chicano park officials had their homes raided, ostensibly for “drugs,” but no drugs were found.
