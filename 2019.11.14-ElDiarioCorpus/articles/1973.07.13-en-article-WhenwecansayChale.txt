When we can say Çhale'

"Rumors have reached our ears that some Chicanos and Anglos have reached a saturation point as far as news about the lettuce and grape boycotts,, is concerned. “Why don't you write about something else?” we hear from second-hand and third-hand sources. Perhaps these calloused individuals would like to hear another side of the United Farm Workers struggle. How about a headline that screams “Teamster goons beat 90 UFW workers while police look on”? Or how about “Migrant workers sprayed with DDT, four farmworkers killed?” At stake, of course, in the battle between Cesar Chavez and the Teamsters-Growers alliance are decent wages, living conditions, and worker benefits for the migrant farmworkers. But more importantly, the central issue in Chavez’ struggle is human dignity, the right of the farmworkers to stand up and say “You cannot deny my humanity any longer, nor can you deny me my Chicano heritage!” This is what the fight is all about. What we should be saturated with are gringo oppression and racism, not news of our hermanos struggle. What we should be tired of hearing are the agonized crys or the farmworkers at the hands of the growers and the Teamsters. You will never be able to “I have heard enough,” even after you find yourself on the picket line or working in some other capacity for the migrants, until the farmworkers wrest equality from their oppressors, and stand both proud and free.
