Free, at lastAnselmo Peralta and Raymund Roybal are free The army of Weld County racists were unable to convict them of the Fort Lupton police station bombing, but they were given a year's probation for pleading no contest to reduced charges of accessory after the fact. The only fair trial would have been no trial at all. We are happy that our brothers are free, but they have paid dearly for their freedom. They have suffered a trial at the hands of the press their families have felt the heavy weight of a year in the courts and they have been made to seem guilty by a system that could not beat them. The Fort Lupton defendants were forced to accept the lesser charges under pressure of prosecution for perjury. It was their word against several federal marshals, need we say more The impotency of truth against paid federal liars has been clearly demonstrated in Brian Sanchez case against the Migra.
