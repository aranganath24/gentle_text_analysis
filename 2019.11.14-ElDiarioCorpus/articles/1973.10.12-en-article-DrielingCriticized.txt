Drieling criticized

Sir, this is to inform you of the farce vote on ratifying Polly and I this week. The 
confusion occurs when Senator Dreiling asked me (Bob Burnell) if I would vote for 
business (profit-type) to be housed on the ground floor of the UMC. I asked Senator 
Dreiling how he would vote. He said, "1 would be in favor of it.” I then replied, “1 guess I 
wouldn’t be playing it safe, if I would vote against it.” Senator Dreiling then responded to 
a statement made in reference to his resignation based on incompetency. Chaos having 
been created, the easiest way to restore order was to quickly vote against ratifying Polly 
and I. Senator Dreiling went against the concensus of the other senators, who were 
willing to accept us by acclamation. Having placed faith in the UMC Board's discretion 
for these two appointments, the other senators were jolted when Senator Dreiling said, 
“I don't know these two." Well, if after asking me how I felt about profit businesses on 
the ground floor of the UMC Senator Dreiling knows me, I will concede he is indeed a 
genius. Robert Burnell
