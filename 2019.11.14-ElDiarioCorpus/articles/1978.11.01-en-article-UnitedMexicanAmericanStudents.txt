United Mexican American Students What is UMAS about? The United Mexican American Student organization is currently involved in areas of interest to Chicano and other students on campus. However, UMAS is sometimes considered a controversial radical organization because of a lack of understanding by students and others. Education - The main priority is in the promotion of higher education for the Chicano. Because C.U. has a small percentage of Chicanos here, of the over 25,000 people enrolled, it is necessary to maintain an organization such as UMAS for those Chicanos who would otherwise become frustrated and drop out as a result of loss of self-identity. Cultural - The Chicano movement is still a relatively new movement; unexposed and misunderstood by the majority of the populace. UMAS is on campus to promote the Chicano culture through such events as speakers, art exhibits, ballete, films and teatro. All of these with one function in mind: to reveal the positive aspects of the Chicano movement and culture. Political - Being a minority ethnic organization, we are very much in the political arena because politics play a major role in the life of the university. UMAS has always tried to reveal to students the need for more student participation in the decision-making on this campus which usually directly or indirectly affect them. Specifically we are trying to defend our democratic right to an education and to understand the fundamental contradictions in our society.
