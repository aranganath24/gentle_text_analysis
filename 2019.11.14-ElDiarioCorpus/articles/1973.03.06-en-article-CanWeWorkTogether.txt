Can we work together?
Plans are presently being formulated for the 1973 UMASEOP summer program. Students and administrators have already begun discussing possible courses, supportive services, and other important parts of the summer program. What is needed is the full cooperation of everyone with expertise in academic planning: students, administrators and faculty members. What is needed is total integration of all La Raza’s talents to produce the best summer program to date. We have the experience of four summer programs, what worked and what didn’t, where improvements need to be made and what should be left alone. All we can ask for is total participation from everyone involved, faculty, staff, and students, to overcome and remedy our past mistakes. Each of you can contribute at your own level. Students can work with their UMAS Board of Directors representatives, since the representatives are open to student input and can work with administrators and faculty members. Administrators and faculty members can pool their efforts where the welfare of the summer students is at stake, since education, more than any other area, will be the salvation of La Raza. Only with full cooperation from everyone involved will the 1973 UMAS-EOP summer program succeed. Keep this fact in mind as the summer approaches.
