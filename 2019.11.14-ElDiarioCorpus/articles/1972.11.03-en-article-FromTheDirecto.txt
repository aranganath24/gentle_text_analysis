From the director
Dear Prospective Student: “Lost to Our Land, Education is Our Stand!" You are probably wondering why I have opened my letter with a slogan such as the above, although it has been used many times in the past, it is still a philosophy that we at LIMAS - EOP believe in and is the springboard for the present and future Chicano Movement. These are the years in which all Chicanos of all ages and beliefs can and will make their mark in history. The Chicano is a complex individual molded from dual heritage and therefore, the movement is a very complex phenomenon. We ask you to join us at the University of Colorado as students to take part in realizing not only your goals, but the goals of the Chicano Movement. The movement is broad and complex and therefore, we welcome students with different talents and beliefs, and welcome what they can contribute to the program. If you do decide in favor of coming to the University of Colorado, we will be looking forward to making available every assistance possible to help you make it here at the University. EDUCATION IS OUR STAND. STAND WITH US. Sincerely, Joe Franco Director UMAS-EOP
