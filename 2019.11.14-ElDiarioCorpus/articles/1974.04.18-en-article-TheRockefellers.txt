The Rockefellers don’t kill people with their own hands… they are probably very non-violent people… the Rockefellers only order the wars… They only run the corporations that make the bombs… they only install the dictators that torture the people… the Rockefellers probably don’t litter… they only run standard oil so it makes a profit… and that involves poisoning the air, spilling oil across the oceans, destroying homes, displacing eskimoes, and killing people…Many Latin Americans get paid less than 75c a day be American corporations… every person that starves in latin America dies because of and for the system that the Rockefellers run, uphold and in the end profit from… the Rockefeller are probably responsible for more misery and death than anyone else in history and they don’t even have to wash the blood off their hands…This cartoon is from “The Incredible $Rocky$... vs. the Power of the People?” a comic book by Joel Andreas.
