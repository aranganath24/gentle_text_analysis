Undocumented workersDear Brothers and Sisters, We were glad to see the excellent article in your May 1977 issue on the problems of undocumented workers. Such articles, which clearly point out the real issues involved in the situation, are greatly needed. They effectively refute the misinformation and outright lies being spread by the racist enemies of immigrant workers and alb Chicano people. A conference has been set for October 28 in San Antonio to plan a response to the new offensive against undocumented workers.
