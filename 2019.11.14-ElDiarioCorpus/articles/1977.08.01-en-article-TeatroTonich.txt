Teatro TonichArturo Bobian a teatro teacher gives his perspective on the performance of this summers teatro group at the University of Colorado at Boulder. This year's summer teatro students were on tour in various parts of Colorado, where they performed outdoors drawing much attention and many emotions. The teatro group consists of new entering Chicano freshmen from primarily Denver, Pueblo and throughout the state of Colorado. The actors presented a series of social and cultural issues which expose the daily occurances in the Latino World.The students chose to call themselves TEATRO TONICH. Tonich is an Aztec word meaning ¡°of the sun¡±, and is indicative of the cultural awareness of these students. Teatro Tonich became very personal to the students. It was their teatro more than it was a class, and this, coupled with a willingness to learn and pride in being chicano made Teatro Tonich successful. The students of this summer are by far one of the most disciplined and aware groups I have ever been involved with. The openness which they displayed and the confidence with which they performed helped to project that awareness, not only to their audiences, but to each other. The sixty students in teatro displayed and the confidence with which they perormed helped to project that awareness, not only to their audiences, but to each other ? The sixty students in teatro displayed and a solidarity that was heartwarming and indicative of the Chicano blood that brings us to each other. I am positive that the feeling of carnalismo prevalent amongst them made lasting impressions on our audiences. More. than any other accomplishment, the teatro students became effective goodwill ambassadors to the communities we visited, representing UMAS, MAP, and the Boulder Chicano.Teatro Tonich performs at San Juan, a low income housing complex in Boulder.
