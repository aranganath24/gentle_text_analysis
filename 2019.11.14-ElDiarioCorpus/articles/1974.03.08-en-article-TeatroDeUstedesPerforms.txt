'Teatro de Ustedes' performsEl Teatro Ustedes, a Chicano theater group, started out the semester performing skits that stress the struggles of Chicano people. What is Chicano theater? It is a group of people involved in the movement who are making changes in the arts and society. But more important, Teatro is a way of expressing a distinction between what is theater and what is reality. It is theater about the revolution and the life of La Raza itself. Las Dos Caras del Patroncito (The two faces of the boss) was, performed Feb. 14 and 15. This play written by Luis Valdez was the first of many that will be performed this semester. Actors Danny and Lupe Vallez, Patsy and Frank Trijillo, Len Avila, and Jose Otero deliver social comment with a light touch of humor. The Teatro has performed at the federal detention center in Denver, Republican Party headquarters in Denver (in opposition to party politics against farmworkers), high schools, and many other places throughout Colorado. The next performance the Teatro will be doing, "Auto de Compadecida ”, a Brazilian play translated in Spanish, will be performed Easter week, April 8, 10, and 12 at 7:30 p.m. in the new deli. "Fando y Lis”, a play put on, in Spanish, by a different class, will be showing Thursday and Saturday at 7:30 in the New Deli. Free beer will be served. So if you’re waiting to catch a 9:O0 movie, or just studying at the library, come by and spend a halfhour of your time to watch something worthwhile.“WORK HARDER, BOY,” says the boss to the farmworker.
