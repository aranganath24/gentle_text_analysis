Student director dedicatedUMAS Student Director, Francisca (Kika) Lopez, wants it to be known that she's here to serve the students. “Our struggles are basically the same...that is, to stay in this university and to deal with each other as people and with each other's problems as a group. Don't hesitate to take advantage of my assistance," she said during a recent interview. Miss Lopez is the third student director since the position was created after the change in the UMAS-EOP administration in May, 1974, when Joe Franco and Paul Acosta resigned their positions as UMAS director and assistant director. Former editor of El Diario, Juan Espinosa was selected in May, 1974, as the first student director under the pretense that he would resign in August, three months later. Albert Vigil was elected as student director in September of that same year. “Being student director involved participation in all UMAS activities,” Miss Lopez said, “my function is to relate student news and activities that are relevant to the organization—a type of liaison between the EOP staff and student lobby."A rumor nas been circulating at the EOP offices in Willard Hall. A long standing policy which admits “high risk students into the University may soon be phased out. Miss Lopez reacted negatively. “We’re going to do our best to stop that,” she said. The 19-year-old student director says she also plans to initiate student participation into "summer planning” by encouraging students to get involved. She explained that summer planning is a method which outlines and implements various activities for incoming students.
