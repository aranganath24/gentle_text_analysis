Chicano pushers exploit raza
Anlomo tsonscll I here is a big problem within the Universities and Chicano barrios concerning drugs. Drugs have been one of the worst enemies in the Chicano Movement because they are used to pacify and exploit our people by the corporate structure. The main purpose of the Chicano Movement is to organize and unite our communities to fight discrimination and oppression of our people. The main exploiters and oppressors of our people are the large corporations, who run this country and many others for their own material wealth. When the corporations see the possibilities of losing their monetary profits because of the Chicano and other movements, they implement many things to pacify and to stop the movements. ~One of the most effective methods used to pacify and even stop these movements are drugs like hallucinogenics heroin, cocaine, and mostly marijuana, known as grass. Grass is very effective in pacifying Chicanos y Chicanus so that they won't get involved, or so that they will stop working in the movement. Many cx-Chicano activists are continually involved with pushing or smoking grass themselves. They
are being used by the "Man" to exploit, pacify, and rip-off the Chicano youth. These Chicano pushers know a lot about the Chicano movement and how to rap heavy but they are only using the movement for their own material wealth, and it is a known fact that the local pushers are making around a 200Cf profit off their sale of grass to our people. When you have Chicanos y Chicanas exploiting our sisters and brothers in Jr. high schools, high schools, and college campuses by selling grass to the youth. It is up to the community, not the pigs, to stop the pushers by any means necessary. One of the Chicano Codes in the Chicano movement is "Thou Shall Not Rip-off or Exploit A Sister or Brother", and when you have people like Dave. Dan. Carl and other Chicanos who are pushing grass and other drugs on our people, they are helping the corporate structure to oppress and exploit our people. When anyone works within, or helps the corporate structure in any way. shape, or form they are also an oppressor of our people. This makes them an enemy of the movement, so that they will be destroyed like the enemy. “ABAJOCON EL VEDEDOR DE DROGAS"
