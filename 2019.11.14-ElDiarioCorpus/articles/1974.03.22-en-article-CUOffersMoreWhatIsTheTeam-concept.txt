CU OFFERS MOREWhat is the team-concept?After reviewing the evaluations from the different components from our last summer program (1973), it was apparent that there was an almost unanimous consensus that the team-concept be reinstated. The team-concept, in its original state however, did not allow for the students' academic differences. Because the students were not grouped according to their abilities, grouping was relatively easy. This same approach cannot be utilized as it was in the past as our present program is structured to provide as much individualized attention as possible. However, it is still felt that the team-concept, in a modified form, can offer numerous advantages. The twenty students will be randomly selected and then placed with the five staff members.Again, this procedure will enable us to place students in specific classes according to their abilities and will help relieve the boredom of going with the same students in every class. In addition, this method of grouping will allow students of varying abilities to help one another within the team. Also, it is our belief that students should not be placed with their respective instructors and/or T.A.'s. This will hopefully allow the students more freedom to discuss problems encountered in a particular class. Because there will obviously not be enough Sociology people to go around, counselors and T.A.'s will be substituted whenever necessary. To ensure success, teams should be required to meet at least once a week.
