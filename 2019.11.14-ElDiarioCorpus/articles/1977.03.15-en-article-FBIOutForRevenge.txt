David Hill, spokesman for the American Indian Movement, speaking before an audience at the University of Colorado earlier this month, said police brutality and FBI harassment were becoming away of life for the Indian people but that they will no longer stand for such treatment. Hill gave the example of Pine Ridge, South Dakota, focal point of Indian activity and resistance, where Indians are constantly being subjected to FBI harassment. Agents bust into peoples homes under the pretense of looking for someone or searching for guns. They bust in doors, shoot the dogs that bark at them, line everybody up against the wall, and threaten to shoot them, he said. Hill also spoke of the upcoming trial of Leonard Peltier, who is accused of aiding and abetting in the murder of two FBI agents at Wounded Knee. Although the two men who were accused of the murder, Dino Butler and Bob Robideaux, have been
acquitted, Peltier stri taces the charges in the upcoming, March 14th trial. According to Hill, The situation was on trial, not just the men. The situation was a self-defense measure, but they are still charging Peltier with aiding and abetting in the battle against the FBI. Because the government lost the case with Dino Butler and Bob Robideaux, they are taking every precaution to win this case and are holding the trial in Fargo, North Dakota, an area just as racist as South Dakota. At different times the FBI has threatened to kill Peltier and attempted to kill Robideaux and Butler. According to Hill the FBI is out for revenge because they lost the battle. A number of demonstrations have been organized around the country to protest Peltiers trial and Hill expressed hope that a demonstration could be organized at the federal center in Denver at the time of the trial.
