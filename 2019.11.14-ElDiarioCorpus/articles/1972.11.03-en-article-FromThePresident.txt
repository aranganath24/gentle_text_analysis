From the president....
Amigos: As president of UMAS, United Mexican American Students, I would first like to thank you parents of UMAS students on behalf of the organization and students for all the sacrifices and efforts that you have gone through in order to bring your sons and daughters to the University of Colorado. I am sure that your family. La Raza will be benefited greatly a.d will be prouder of them as the semester goes by. I would also like to take this opportunity to perhaps clear up some of the misconceptions that exist about UMAS. To begin with, UMAS is a Chicano student organization on campus that siricSlts inception in 1968 (it started with 9 members and now has 700) has existed to create change within the university structure as it relates 4o the Mexican American student. Some of our efforts have brought about: Mexican student enrollment increase from under ten In 1968 to over 1200 in fall of 1972: the sensitizing of student population to the plight of the Chicano in the barrios and fields; the establishment of programs such as UMAS-EOP summer program which have served to aid Chicanos in starting through the University, and many others. As an organization we support all others whose efforts are for the betterment of our people. We do this because it is our belief since we will be the doctors, lawyers and teachers of our communities, we must not forget all the injustices and hardships that our people are subjected to. I realize these few words cannot begin to develop the faith and the trust from you. Then we must earn through active efforts to bring more of our brothers and sisters up her to both learn and teach. I only hope that all you hear of our efforts to reach our goals you weigh keeping in mind: UMAS is an organization not built on hate or on idle words of promises to do something, but rather on a love for our people and a commitment to help. Sincermente, Martin A. Gonzales UMAS President
