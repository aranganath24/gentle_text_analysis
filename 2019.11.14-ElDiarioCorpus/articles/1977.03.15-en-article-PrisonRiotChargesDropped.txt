Canon City District Attorney John Anderson has dropped felony riot charges against 55 inmates involved in the fall prison riot. The decision came after preparation to try them became too expensive. Most of the 55 cases had gone through preliminary hearings and judges found probable cause for trial. Anderson sought the dismissals explaining that it would be difficult to prove each individual case. According to Jerry Agee, director of the State Division of Correctional Services, each of the 55 inmates had been disciplined by the prison administraiton by segregating them from the rest of the prison population and withholding any money they might earn to pay for state property damage. Cellhouse 7 inmates complained that after the November riot, prison officials reacted harshly. They stopped the disturbance with fire hoses and later inmates were forced to sleep wet and cold without blankets and linen replacements.
