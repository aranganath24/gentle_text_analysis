With only two months remaining on their present contract, Farah workers are preparing for upcoming negotiations. The majority of employees are Chicanas, who have been dissatisfied with their present three year contract. Five years ago the women went on strike and were victorious in obtaining a contract. The company has shown signs of resistance to the workers needs. In the past year Farah refused to recognize insurance provisions of the contract. Workers are determined to gain a good contract and will not accept any excuses from the company or union officials. The laborers negotiating committee is demanding better wages, improved working conditions, lower quotas, plantwide seniority and respect as Chicana workers. The committee is organizing workers inside the plants. Signing up people for the union and preparing them for a possible strike if necessary to achieve victory. Company officials believe recent profit losses are due to the unionizing of the Farah Company, while ignoring the current economic crisis of the world. The United States economy has fluctuated often in the past, but only continuous profit at the expense of human needs has prevailed. Workers believe the best way to oppose the abuse of Farah is to have a strong democratic union. Employees have organized a rank and file workers committee to combat problems such as layoffs and wage cuts.
