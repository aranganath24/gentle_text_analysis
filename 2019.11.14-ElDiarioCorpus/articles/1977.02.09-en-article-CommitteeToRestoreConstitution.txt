The Committee to Restore the Constitution will meet to formalize plans of action in maintaining law and order in Akron during the upcoming "Chicano Bomber Trail". If we permit, the judge and officers of the court will be jeered, the court mocked and unrestrained actions will take place in and out of the court room. Akron may be left in shreds. Professional squads have not halted such acts in Detroit, Chicago, or LA. We doubt they will be effective here. The answer must be that we citizens gird ourselves to react positively, firmly and efficiently to any act detrimental to the best interests of our community. A representative of the Sheriff's office has been invited to attend. Do Not Miss This!
