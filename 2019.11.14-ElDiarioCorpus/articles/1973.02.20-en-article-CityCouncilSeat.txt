City Council Seat
Lucero seeks nod
According to Euvaldo Valdez, speaking for the Citizens in Support of J. Carlos Lucero, Lucero has “knowledge of the political social and economic situations throughout the state of Colorado” and "can provide the final element of balance that our council has acquired over the last two years” "What is needed now is an expression of support for Carlos Lucero from as broad a segment of the Boulder community as possible,” Valdez added. Written statements of support for Lucero can be sent to Euvaldo Valdez, 4635 Ludlow Street, in Boulder. The recent resignation of Mr. John Buechner from the Boulder City Council has created a vacancy which will be filled by appointment prior to February 26, 1973. Several prominent area Chicanos are pooling their efforts to place the name J. Carlos Lucero, a Boulder resident for six years, on the list of citizens being considered for the vacant seat. The Chicanos supporting Lucero are asking that concerned citizens contact their councilmen to express support for Lucero. Lucero has been co-chairman of the state equal rights commission for the Democratic Party, a member of the Advisory Committee on Rural Services for the Archdiocese of Denver, the Vice Chairman for the Mexican Americans of Boulder County United, and has held numerous other volunteer posts. Coordinating the efforts to have Lucero appointed are David Moore of the Chicano Law Students; Richard Garcia, Migrant Action Program Director, and other area Chicanos.
