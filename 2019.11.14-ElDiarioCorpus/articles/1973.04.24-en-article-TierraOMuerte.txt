Tierra o MuerteThe cover on this issue of El Diario carries a message which is close to the hearts of all Chicanos, ÒTierra o Muerte!Ó This cry, which has been shouted across hundreds of years of history by the Hidalgos, Zapatas, Tijerinas, Gonzaleses and Chavezes, has been the battle cry for the return of the land to those who work it For 25,000 years the ancestors of la raza have lived in harmony with nature. Unlike the Anglo who raped the land, the Indio and Mestizo worshipped the land. They took from the land only what they needed to survive. The need for maintaining a balance with the environment is not new to Bronze peoples. It was not they who annihilated the buffalo. It was not they who hunted for trophies and left the carcasses to rot. This week is Earth Week, it is not to be taken lightly. But, we cannot be like the Anglo and bury symbolic Ford Mavericks and then return to our plastic worlds. We must continue in our struggle to recover our land. Only when all men learn to love the land can we again live in harmony with nature. "Tierra o Muerte!Ó, Land or Death," perhaps this cry has a greater meaning than recovering the land or die trying. When we lose our spiritual ties with the earth, when the earth dies, we too, will die. Our fight is not only to reclaim our land, but to restore it to its former role as Mother to mankind.
