In an all our effort to support the total boycott of head lettuce at the University United Farmworker (UFWA) supporters are asking students to vote ÒNOÓ to head lettuce in the ASUC referendum Feb. 26 and 27.There will be two separate polls taken, one of the entire student body, and one of just dorm residents. The following wording for the ballot is expected to be: CHECK ONE!I call upon the university to refrain from purchasing or serving any head lettuce for the duration of the lettuce boycott. I call upon the university to purchase and serve head lettuce regardless of the origin of the lettuce.
