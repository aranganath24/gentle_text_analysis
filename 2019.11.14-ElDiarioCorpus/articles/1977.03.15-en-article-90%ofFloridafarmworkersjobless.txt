90% of Florida farm workers jobless
On January 31, 1977, President Carter declared Florida State to be a major disaster area. Harrison Wiliams (Chairperson, Senate Committee on Labor and Public Welfare) and Gaylord Nelson (Chairperson, Subcommittee on Employment, Poverty and Migratory Labor) acknowledged in their letter of January 25, 1977 to Acting Secretary of Labor, Alfred Albert, that at least 80,000 and perhaps as many as 130,000 farmworkers will be indefinitely unemployed because of the winter freeze which struck vegetable and citrus fruit crops in Florida and other Gulf States. According to the available information, the major disaster areas arc located in Floridas nine southern counties. As over 90% of the vegetable harvest was destroyed, farmworkers are unemployed and it is highly unlikely that the near future holds any promise of employment. In addition, while it is estimated that the
citrus harvest is operating at full employment, over 20,000 people will become unemployed within the next week when the dead fruit has been picked and processed for concentrate. The Presidential declaration of Florida as a disaster area makes emergency Federal funds available. Potenially, funds are available for Special Emergency Unemployment, Emergency Food Stamps and Emergency Housing Assistance. The only response to date has been the release to Florida of funds which alleviate the growers financial crisis with low-interest loans and begin to address the workers human needs with emergency unemployment payments. These unemployment funds pay $64 per week per worker up to 90 days, retroactive to January 17. Monies from the Emergency Food Stamp and Emergency Housing Assitance funds have not been requested and therefore have not been released.
