Mi Raza del Sol

“Mi Raza Del Sol,” by Agustin Cordova of Boulder, Colorado, on 45 record, was recently released by Del Poso Publishing agency. “Mi Raza Del Sol” is one ranchera that is destined along the same line as the revolutionary corridos that were written 80 years ago they continue to remain in the hearts and minds of today’s Chicanos and northern Mejicanos. Inspiring, full of honest sincerity and Chicanismo, this 45 cut is performed well by

Cordova who plays lead and rhythm guitar; the guitarron and lead and background vocals, on separate tracks. The Tex-Mex style of Cordova’s records are still unique in the music industry because the lyrics are meaningful and the beat is alive. This song is certain to be on the lips of every Colorado Chicano ranchero player soon. And in the spirit of Chicanismo: “Que viva mi raza del sol.”
