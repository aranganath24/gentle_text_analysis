EDITORIALS. Sodom and Gomorrah. IT has been said that Boulder is slowly becoming a modern-day "Sodom and Gomorrah” because of the "increasing corruption.” Called the drug capital of America, Boulder has an abundance of drugs, free sex to be found just around the corner, record-breaking number of streakers, and now sexual preference; should or shouldn't homosexuals be discriminated against in areas of employment, housing, etc.? First we must examine those people who call Boulder a modern day “Sodom and Gomorrah,” the complainers. Could it be they too are contributing to the increase of corruption? One such complainer especially against sexual preference is Mr. Middle Class. Mr. Middle Class, in the privacy of his neighbor’s house, sees no harm in swapping his wife; after all he does go to church on Sunday. How s about Mr. Dirty Old Man who subscribes to dirty books, reads them, then goes out and tries to pick up little girls at the neighborhood schools. His little old wife? OH, don’t worry about her, she's out collecting the high rent from the tenants who live in the old shacks. Then there's Mr. and Mrs. Well Off. They're middle age, have a nice home, but the sad part is, neither of them know the other is having an affair with someone else. The list could go on forever. The aforementioned people all have one thing in common… They all hate homosexuals and don't want to see Boulder become a SODOM. Unfortunately these complainers don’t realize they themselves are the true corrupters and shouldn't complain. Therefore, a word to all homosexuals. An angle will be sent to warn you of the destruction of SODOM and GOMORRAH, and all those who are corrupt will be destroyed or turn to salt.
