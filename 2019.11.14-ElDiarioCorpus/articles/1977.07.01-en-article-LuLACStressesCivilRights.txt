LuLAC stresses Civil Rights
Leo E. Cardenas, Director of the Rocky Mountain Region of the Community Relations Services (CRS) believes the passive mood of many civil rights organizations have resulted in the death of many programs geared at preventing riots. The reduction of police community relations units, dispensing with minority affairs officers by national organizations and public corporations and the constant battle against
providing monies for self-help community organizations, have all contributed to the threat of violence reoccuring. Speaking at the 1977 League of United Latin American Citizens (LULAC) National Convention, Cardenas spoke of possible race riots once again dividing our cities. This is due to the contented state of mind of many civil organizations and leaders. While some organizations
rights leaders must be prepared to work toward solving the problems which lie ahead. Many elements which played a part in sparking the late 60s riots are surfacing. A 42.1 per cent unemployment among Hispanics and resentment Chicanos moving into all-white communities are a few. Harrassment of school children, cross burnings, firebombings and vandalism have all occurred.
