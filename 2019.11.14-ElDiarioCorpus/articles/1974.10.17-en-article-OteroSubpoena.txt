Otero subpoena
The subpoena for Raza worker Ray Otero was dismissed in Denver’s Federal Court Monday, OcL 7, because the Grand Jury had no legal grounds to subpoena Otero. The ‘witch hunt’ the Grand Jury has launched against Raza workers is over again. It was sad to see that none of the Chicano organizations or communities in Colorado showed up to support our Brother. Where was UMAS? Where was the Crusade? Where was Greeley? And where were the people? Where were all the gente that have constantly reminded us that they are supporters and workers de la Raza? One would think that no mas hablan yo no trabajan.' Some of the organizations may say that they were not aware of the date of Ray’s trial. They should have found out. Brother Ray knows if and when their trial comes up. Ignorance is no excuse especially when it involves the well being of a fellow worker. It’s discouraging and a damn shame to see the movement becoming so relaxed. Sin Mas Miguel Carreras
