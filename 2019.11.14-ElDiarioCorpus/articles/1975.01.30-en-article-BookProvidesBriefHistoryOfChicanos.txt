Book provides brief history of Chicanos
VIVA LA RAZA: The Struggle of the Mexican American People by Elizabeth Sutherland Martinez and Enriqueta Longeaux y Vasquez, Doubleday & Company Inc., $4.95. This publication gives a good, brief history of the contemporary Chicano movement, attempting to place it in a proper historical perspective. To a certain degree, it succeeds. The authors present general factual information concerning historical and contemporary events in a manner that entertains and enlightens the reader. They document Chicano occurrences throughout Aztlan. giving some insight for those who have been unable to keep abreast of events in other localities. The book is valuable in that it chronicles ideas, styles, and moods of the times as they relate to and reflect on today’s Raza. However, it falls short with its lack of indepthness and analysis. The information is sketchy, nothing more. At times the reader is left questioning the authors' sources as well as the information. One blatant example is their discussion of the United Farm Workers of America organization which leaves the reader believing that the UFW is only struggling with the growers and not the Teamsters as well. There is no real attempt to delve below the surface of many events, to analyze the given situation and identify the problems, their causes and effects, and present political ideologies and philosophies relevant to the actions involved, something crucial to a work such as this. It’s worthwhile reading for all Raza.
