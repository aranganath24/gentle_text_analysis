We are to blame!We must all share responsibility for the setback the United Farm Workers Union was dealt when 85 per cent of the Coachella Valley grape growers signed contracts with the Teamsters Union. The grape growers would never have dared to sign with the Teamsters if the growers were aware of total nationwide support for the UFWU. Grower fear of a nationwide secondary boycott of grapes should have forced them to give the farmworkers decent living conditions, medical provisions, and every benefit the UFWU has fought to get for so long. Instead, seeing that the Lettuce boycott and strike have not yet succeeded, the growers condemned the farmworkers to more suffering and misery by signing contracts directly with the Teamsters. When Cesar Chavez visited Denver recently, he said, ÒI think they (the grape growers) are really fools if they want another fight, but you have to hand it to them, they were fools before.Ó Since the growers have challenged our ability to fight their inhumane treatment of the farmworkers, we must prove them to be the fools they are. Cesar will soon call for a nationwide boycott of grapes. We should do all we can to show both the lettuce and grape growers that they cannot continue to enslave farmworkers, and that we stand united to beat them.
