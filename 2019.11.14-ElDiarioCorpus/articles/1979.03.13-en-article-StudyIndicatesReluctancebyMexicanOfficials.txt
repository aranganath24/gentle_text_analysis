Study Indicates Reluctance by Mexican Officials

WASHINGTON A Senate study released Thursday, March 1, says Mexico is unlikely to be a major exporter of crude oil in the next decade. The report indicates that despite the awesome magnitude of Mexico’s oil and natural gas reserves, the United States cannot rely on this supply because of unwillingness by Mexican officials to produce the oil. The “study” was prompted by Iran’s recent interruption of its exporting activities.
