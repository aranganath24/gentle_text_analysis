LONELY INMATES
For the first time in the history of the institution, a group of students were allowed to visit with federal inmates. Sister Betty Edl of St. Thomas Aquinas Church along with a group of I 3 people visited lonely inmates detained at the Englewood, Colorado, Federal Youth Center. According to Sister Edl, the February 7, excursion involved two hours of friendly discussion between the visitors and inmates. Sister Edl said that the inmates were starved for communication with the outside world. The inmates range from I 8 to 25 years-of-age and come from many cultural backgrounds. Sister Edl commented, a number of inmates are from outside the Colorado state border and have not seen their families or have had visitors in months. Also there is very special need for Spanish speaking visitors because there are Mexican Nationals being held at the Center. The next visit will leave St. Thomas Aquinas church February 22, at 5:45 p.m. and transportation will be provided. For further information contact Sister Betty Edl 443-8386.
