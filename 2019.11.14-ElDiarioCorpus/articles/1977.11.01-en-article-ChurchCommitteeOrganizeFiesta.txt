Church Committee Organize FiestaThe Bilingual-Bicult ural Committee of St. Thomas Aquinas University Parish is sponsoring a fiesta for the Celebration of La Virgen de Guadelupe. The fiesta will take place at St. Thomas Aquinas Church, at 14th and Aurora, on December 11, 1977, from 11:00 a.m. to 5:00 p.m. Proceeds from the fiesta will go to the Lafayette Tutoring Program, an organization which works with Chicano youth. If anyone is interested in helping to plan the fiesta, a committee planning meeting will be held every Sunday from 12:00 to 12:30 in the basement of the church. Any group or organization is also invited to sponsor a booth for such things as Mexican food, arts and crafts, information-sharing, etc. A donation of $lO.OO is encouraged, but not required, to set up a booth. This donation will go to help defray the costs of the fiesta. If you are interested in sponsoring a booth contact Euvaldo Valdez at 494-7496 or 442-2430. The fiesta will also feature a talent show consisting of local talent. A cash award will be given to the most entertaining Chicano talent. Entries can include music, dance, poetry reading, teatro, etc. If you are interested in entering the talent show contact Virginia Maestas at 499-0359. The Committee wishes to extend to everyone an invitation to the fiesta, as well as an invitation to become involved in the planning.
