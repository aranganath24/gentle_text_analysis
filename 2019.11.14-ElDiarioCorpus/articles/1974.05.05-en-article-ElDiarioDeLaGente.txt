EL DIARIO de la GENTE
Much of this issue of El Diario has been set aside for poems, short stories and other forms of Chicano literature taken from a variety of sources. In no way does the staff attempt to take credit for the works, nor do we intend to take the authors' rights to publication. In fact, it is our intent to stimulate an interest in the works of these artists and of other Chicano writers. Some of the writings have never been published before. Of the material taken from already published books, information concerning the author, the publishing house, etc., is provided for anyone wishing to order them. In the past Chicanos have not had their works published. It is not surprising. With the average education for Chicanos at less than nine years and an attempt by the dominant society to ignore anything "foreign." . , There are many outstanding works being produced in the barrios, los campos, the prisons and even the universities of Aztlan. These presented here are only a small sampling. Special thanks to Tom Vallegos for contributing much of his time in the selection of these unique works of art.
