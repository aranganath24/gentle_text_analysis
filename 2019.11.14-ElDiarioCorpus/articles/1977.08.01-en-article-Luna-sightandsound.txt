Luna: sight and sound¡°We want to be known as a show group with ¡°sights and sounds¡± so good the audience will want more,¡± says Rick Archuleta of Luna, one of the newer groups to Denver s music scene. Although the average age of the group is 17, they all have been playing since they were 5 or 6, and now have enough material for about 30 original compositions. The group, all from the Denver area have played throughout the state in cities such as Alamosa, Boulder, and Sterling. Soon they will be playing in Lafayette, Minturn, Del Norte, Pueblo, and at a concert at the air force base in Cheyenne. Their main emphasis is on soul, disco, and Mexican music, but they are versatile and can play the kind of music they feel an audience will appreciate most. All four members plan to go to CU to major in music, but at present are planning to improve the group more by adding a keyboard player and maybe some horns. Recently the group purchased new equipment, for as Rick Archuleta puts it, ¡°to play the best, you have to have the best equipment.¡± The group feels that since they are young, they have the potential to progress more than any other group in the area already has.LUNA, a promising new group to the Denver scene.
