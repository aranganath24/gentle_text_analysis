ANOTHER,MISCARRIAGE OF JUSTICE?Despite poor prosecution, jury convicts CovarrubiasUMAS student Margie Covarrubias was convicted this month on a charge of third degree assault. The trial which lasted one week was a constant focal point of concerned minority students on campus. Margie was accused of striking Betsy Spomer at a UCSU (student government) meeting last fall. Violence broke out for approximately 60 seconds when UCSU passed EC-4, a bill that opponents refered to as ¡°sexist, racist, and ill-con-ceived." EC-4 eliminated mandatory funding for student groups. It was initiated "to lower the cost of student fees." Ironically, however student groups only receive 2 percent of student fees. Blacks, Chicanos, Indians, Whites, and Asians united at that September 29 meeting to expose EC-4.Despite numerous contradictions made by prosecution witnesses, the all-white jury of 7 men and 5 women handed down the guilty verdict after only two hours of deliberations. Upon receiving the verdict, Covarrubias asked Judge Steinburg if she could address the jury. She mentioned, "Although I¡¯ve been convicted by a jury, it is not a jury of my peers." During the course of the trial, supporters of Margie Covarrubias packed the courtroom in protest of what they termed, ¡°trumped-up" lies. According to reliable sources the Boulder D.A.¡¯s Office, the Grand Jury, and the University of Colorado Student Union, collaborated in the ¡°frameup" in an attempt to disunify the multi-national unity displayed at the Sept. 29 meeting."Organize, persist, defend oar right to exist,¡± shouted students as they protested at Covarrubias¡¯ trial.
