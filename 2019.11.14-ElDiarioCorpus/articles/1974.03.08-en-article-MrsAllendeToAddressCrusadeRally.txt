Mrs. Allende to address Crusade rallyMrs. Hortensia Bussi de Allende will address the "Day of Solidarity" rally to support the Crusade for Justice which will be held in Denver, March 17. She recently was permitted to speak at an official meeting of the UN Human Rights Commission on February 25, 1974. Representing the Women’s International Democratic Federation, Mrs. Allende described the deprivation of human rights since the fascist coup of September 11, 1973 and called for international support of the Chilean’s struggle for justice. "I have come before you as a wife and mother of a destroyed Chilean home, as has happened to so many others. I come before you representing hundreds of widows, thousands of orphans, of a people suffering from a “state of war", imposed by...obedient servants of fascism that represents violations of each and every right which, according to the Declaration of December 10, 1948. This Declaration establishes that every man has the right to life, liberty and security. I could spend days addressing you on the subject of how the fascist dictatorship in my country has outdone the worst of Hitler’s Nazism. “The sanctity of the home, the family and free communication guaranteed by the Declaration of Human Rights, no longer exists in my country. Under the facade of a “state of war" and martial law, nothing is respected by the fascist military. They have also violated the international law of asylum, turning the embassies into virtual prisons for all those to whom the junta denies a safe-conduct Government. “The right u free education has also been wiped away. Thousands of students been expelled for simply having belonged to a leftist party. Young people, just a few months away from obtaining their degrees, have been deprived of five or more years of higher education. My country, my people have committed no other crime than that of trying to free itself from its exploiting masters and recover its basic wealth.”Mrs. Hortensia Bussi de Allende
