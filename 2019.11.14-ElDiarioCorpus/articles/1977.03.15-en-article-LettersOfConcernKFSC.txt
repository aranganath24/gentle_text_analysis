We the undersigned are faithful listeners of Radio Station KFSC, and have always enjoyed the Spanish programs that KFSC offers. We are all against the sale of Radio Station KFSC to Lalino Braodcasting Company. Because we know Latino Broadcasting Company would not serve in the best interest of the Chicano Community. Ed Romero who is president of Latino Broadcasting Company was once General Manager of Radio Station KFSC, (November 1975 May 1976) and tried lo change the music of KFSC, which we as listeners did not approve of. Latino Broadcasting Company has also locked up the record library of KFSC. Latino Broadcasting Company is trying to purchase KFSC with S.B.A. money by using A.S.I. The executors says that the radio station is being sold because of tax purposes, we feel that it is because of executors fees and because Richard Lesko is a close friend of Ed Romero who has never done a thing for the Chicano community. We are demanding an F.C.C. court hearing so we can testify. We also know that Lalino Broadcasting Company has many mistakes in their application such as stating that Latino Broadcasting Company ascertained Mr. Rodolfo Corky Gonzales when we know that he wasnt. Until these matters are cleared we are asking F.C.C. to stop the sale.
