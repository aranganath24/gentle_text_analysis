Liquor Mart target of rallyCries of “Si Se Puede” were heard last April 5, as students, gathered around the fountain area, in preparation for a march on Liquor Mart. The march was carried out to demonstrate support for the United Farm Workers (UFW) and the boycott against Gallo Wines, and to demand that Liquor Mart remove all Gallo Wines from its shelves. About 100 people, most of whom were students, participated in the orderly march, arid after arriving at Liquor Mart, the demonstrators listened to various speakers from different campus organizations.Jess Vigil, former ASUC Triexecutive, spoke in behalf of the Aztlan Defense Committee. Vigil asked for support for Judy Sandoval and Randy Esquibel, two defendants who are accused of painting slogans on campus walls and asked for support of all political prisoners. Len Avila also spoke, explaining the reason for the boycott and the necessity to get Gallo wines of the liquor store shelves. Following the speakers, El Teatro de Ustedes performed an act written by Luis Valdez. The students then proceeded to picket Liquor Mart and leaflet the customers. Liquor Mart was singled out because it is the largest liquor store in the Boulder area. The Farm Labor Task Force met earlier this year with the manager asking him to comply by removing Gallo products from the shelves. The manager, however, refused but did agree to display leaflets concerning the boycott. FLTF also met with other liquor store owners and some have agreed to remove the scab wines until the dispute between Gallo and the UFW is settled.
