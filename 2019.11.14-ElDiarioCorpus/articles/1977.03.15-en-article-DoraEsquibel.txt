Her activism in the affairs of the community have, in the eyes of the La Junta people, labeled her a revolutionist. In an interview with El Diario , Dora said she was a victim of society. She said she has been constantly harrased by local police for her involvement in an incident that happened in La Junta which her son Randy was involved in. She now faces two years imprisonment.
