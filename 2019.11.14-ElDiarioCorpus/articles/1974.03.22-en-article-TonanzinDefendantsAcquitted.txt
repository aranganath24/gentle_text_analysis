Tonanzin defendant’s acquittedESTANCIA, N.M. Seven Chicano dependents in the Escuela Tonantzin ‘‘shoot-out” were acquitted March 11, of charges of assault with intent to murder when testimony in their trial clearly indicated that the two wounded police officers were victims of police bullets. During the 16-day trial, Deputy District Attorney Bruce Kaufman, of Santa Fe, was unable to prove the "Santa Fe 7" were guilty of any wrong doing the night of the police attack on Escuela Tonantzin Sept. 3, 1973, which left a visitor to the school, Linda Montoya, dead. According to testimony at the trial, Ms. Montoya was shot and another Chicano was wounded as they attempted to come out of the besieged school."to give themselves up.” Just before the fatal .shooting, an order to “shoot the bastards” was given, witnesses reported. Ms. Montoya was shot by Police Officer Antonio Griego, who was found innocent of any wrong doing, but has since disappeared. The vicious attack on Escuela Tonantzin was similar in many ways to the earlier police attack on the Crusade for Justice’s Escuela Tlatelolco which left Luis "Junior” Martinez dead. Police testimony at the resulting trials has been highly contradictory and their has been no proof that Chicanos did any shooting during the "shoot-outs.” Chicanos see the attacks as efforts to eliminate independent Chicano schools. Observers in New Mexico stated, "We saw the lies and the prejudices of many lawmen... we also saw the brainwashed condition of many Chicano policemen." Following the Santa Fe incident the local representatives of the Catholic church attempted to remove the Escuela Tonantzin from the former convent. Now that the courts have ruled in the defendants' favor, the community is awaiting the church's response.
