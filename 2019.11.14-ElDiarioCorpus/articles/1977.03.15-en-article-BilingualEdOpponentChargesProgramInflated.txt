A leading opponent of the state bilingual law told the Colorado Senate committee tha the number of children who need bilingual education has been greatly inflated. Naomi Bradford who has fought other Denver School Board members on the subject said that in at least two Denver schools she can prove children who speak and understand English were classified as needing bilingual education. According to Bradford, of 67 children termed linguistically different at Elyria Elementary, 64 weren't recommended by their teachers as needing bilingual education. The charges came at Senate Committee hearings on a bill introduced by committee chairman Hugh Fowler. The bill would repeal the states bilingual-bicultural education law, leaving only $1 million for a tutoring program for children who cant speak English. Faye Dabney, a Colorado Springs teacher said the program took time away from reading, writing and spelling. However, Ross Barrett, a parent who said he spoke for 900 parents in Colorado Springs said they were happy with the bilingual program and had even asked the school board to extend it to fourth, fifth and sixth grade. According to Barrett, children are excited about school and are learning to speak and appreciate both Spanish and English. He urged the committee to give bilingual education a chance, because one year was too short a time to evaluate the law passed in 1975.
