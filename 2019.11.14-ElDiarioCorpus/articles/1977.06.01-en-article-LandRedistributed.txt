Some individuals chose to stay to fight the battle in Mexico. As one of his last official acts of office, former Mexican president Luis Echicverra declared thousands of acres of land open to settlement by Mexican citizens. This action was immediately attacked by industrial agribusiness and their supporters in the Mexican government, who conspired to cripple the economy. But the newly-elected  mexican president, Jose Lopes Portillos, immediately moved to give the land back to the large families and agributiness interests. However, President Portillos is thus far unwilling to forcefully overrun the settlers, but scattered skirmishes between settlers and los federates have resulted in deaths on both sides and continue. Mexico itself faces the same economic situation of many other of the second and third world nations. There exists great disparity between the rich and the poor in Mexico; the nation cannot compete with the modern technologies of the adjoining U.S. or with other industrialized nations; government officials work hand in hand with a repressive police force to maintain a status quo of corruption and of the politics of influence. There is hope in the rich oil fields discovered in Mexico several years ago, should the government manage to avoid U.S. exploitation of this rich resource. There is also hope in ihe struggle of the settlers who have thus far not been budged from the land they occupied. However, for the majority of the workers, the best hope lies in trying to gain entry in the U.S. for no matter what the risks are in coming to this country, the reward may be the continuance of life.
