SHOPLIFTING

a very large move for very small people

Shoplifting. In terms of the new math, it’s explained as “One Plus None, Take Away Anything, Equals up to 50 Plus 20 in and 20 out with a Remainder of 365." In terms of what it means to you ... who can answer? Look at the facts; Of those persons apprehended in the University Book Center for shoplifting in a recent 4-month period, one third of the cases have had court action to date. Of these cases, 85% resulted in GUILTY verdicts. The lightest penalty

imposed was $25 fine plus court costs and five days’ suspended sentence. On the heavy side, $5O fine and court costs were leveled plus 20 days in jail and 20 days suspended sentence. Plus one year of probation. The average value of the shoplifted items?... about $1.65. For that, the shoplifters risked time, their money and, certainly not least, reputation for years to come. That doesn’t work in anybody’s favor. Least of all yours.

One [You) Plus None [No thinking), Take Away Anything [51.65 average,) Equals up to $5O Fine plus 20 days in jail and 20 days suspended leaving a Remainder of 365 days Probation. Think about it. Very carefully. «p p'unlker/thr • BOOK Center IN THE UMC
