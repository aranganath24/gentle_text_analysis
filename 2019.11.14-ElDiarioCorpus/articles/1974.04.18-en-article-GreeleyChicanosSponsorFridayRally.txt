Greeley Chicanos sponsor Friday rallyGreeley Chicanos are currently planning follow-up activities alter a 19-hour takeover of the University of Northern Colorado Student Center building. A rally is planned for Friday, April 19. at 1:00 in Greeley on the UNC campus to protest police inaction after a bomb threat was received at an UMAS students dance. The Greeley Chicanos occupied the building Saturday night and much of Sunday after campus police failed to react convincingly about their intentions to protect the Chicanos at the dance. The police reaction was especially questionable after a recent bombing of a UNC dormitory, where campus police immediately evacuated the building and called in Greeley police officers and detectives. During the occupation the Chicanos allied for an investigation into police procedures and policies, and for the creation of a citizen review board to monitor police department operations. The Chicanos also called for an affirmative action program at the University to hire more minority teachers and staff members at UNC. The Chicanos were also angered because Jose Calderon, who has taught at Aimes Junior College and UNC is not allowed to teach now at the University. The UMAS organization at UNC is coordinating the Friday rally. We urge all interested Chicanos to attend and participate.
