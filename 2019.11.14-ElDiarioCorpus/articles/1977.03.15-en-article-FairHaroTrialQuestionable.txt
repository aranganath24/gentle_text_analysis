Juan Haros chances of receiving a fair trial are questionable if the trail is similar to the trial preparations. Police informant Joseph Cordovas testimony resulted in the ruling by Judge Leonard Plank to allow search warrants to be issued in a raid and search of Juan Haros home and business in light of Cordovas low credability. The prosecution relied heavily on Cordovas testimony despite contradictions throughout the hearings. When asked who he had spoken to after Haro had been arrested, Cordova stated at the pretrial hearing that he had talked to no one after the arrest. Officers contended that they had spoken to Cordova after the arrest of Haro and used information given by
Cordova to secure the search warrant. On another occasion on the witness stand, Cordova contradicted his previous testimony and remembered he had spoken to an officer not once but three times on the day in question. Cordovas credibility as a responsible witness in this case leaves much to be desired. A source connected with the trial summed it up best. Cordovas contradictions during his testimony proves that he is a liar, cant be believed and the case based on his testimony will also make the government a liar. It is apparent the coaching of Cordova by the police will be quite intensive between now and the trail. A slip like the last one might cost Cordova his new life and the new identity as promised by the police.
