Sherrifs kill migrant worker
A Chicano died in the Imperial County Jail June 18 from alleged neglect by sheriff s department officers, according to the United Farm Workers of America press release. Though the man, Rafael Garcia Rodriguez, was not a farm worker, UFWA lawyers are now trying to get the sheriff suspended on charges stemming from that death. The release stated that Rodriguez was in the jail with
UFWA striking melon workers, though his sentence stemmed from totally unrelated circumstances. Union workers reported that the man was in need of medical treatment when he was placed in a cell by himself and denied food and water for two days. When other people told the officers the man needed medical care, the response was, "Fuck him. Let him starve,” the release stated.
