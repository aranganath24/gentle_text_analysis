Will we fight for a Chicano V.P.?A new dean for minority affairs, a position which has long been called for by minority and campus program directors for several months, will be included in President Frederick Thieme's staff reorganization proposal. The acting vice-president for student and minority affairs, James Corbridge, will probably move up to a vice provost slot creating the open slot if the proposal passes. Corbridge came under fire from Chicanos last semester when the financial crisis came to a head. Chicanos called for Corbridge’s resignation because they wanted someone in that position who would be sympathetic to the needs of minority students. This reshuffling proposal has met with dissonance from the Chicano community. They feel that the proposal is another way of pacifying Chicanos. Chicanos asked for a vice-president position, not a deanship. They feel that their past problems with university bureaucrats will not change with a minority dean. The dean will still be answerable to Corbridge, thus the situation will not be resolved by playing musical chairs. ASUC tri-executive, Jess Vigil, had this to say about the proposal, “It's a reshuffling job that is going to amount to nothing. They are going to have the same people doing the same job. We asked for a vice-president slot and they try to give us a deanship. We don't want to be answerable to Corbridge again." Supposedly Thieme will ask all minority groups to participate in the selection of the new dean.
