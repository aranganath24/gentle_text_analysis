1.4 Million dollars unmet need

Once again the university administration has not faced its responsibility in providing the necessary financial aid assistance to the students. The figure 1.4 million dollars indicates this. This figure equals those monies the university was not able to supply each individual student applying for financial assistance. The student is asked to fill out a statement in which he states his estimated yearly expenses, tuition and fees. He must also state other types of support which may include contributions from parents, outside scholarships and

summer earnings. The university then evaluates each individual's basic needs, taking into consideration the situation of each individual. As an example, the estimated living expense for a single, resident student for the academic year 1973 - 1974 is $2450. The university may determine that your need is such that you are allowed to receive $2150. The unmet need, is three hundred dollars. However, the unmet need is probably higher since the $2450 does not take into consideration the high cost of living.
