Board considers bussing

A request for bus transportation for elementary school children living at Colorado Court 
and East Campus housing to and from Aurora 7 School will be presented to the Boulder 
Valley School Board District, RE-2, at their October 29th meeting. Concerned parents of 
the 96 children who reside at the family housing complexes are asking the school board 
to take whatever action is necessary to insure that funds be allocated for bus trans-
portation to and from the school in the interest of the safety and well-being of these 
children. Each of the alternate routes taken by the young children to Aurora 7 school is 
hazardous. This includes not only the route through the field, but also the recommended 
route following the roadway. The children taking this hazardous route cut through a 
field, cross a ravine, walk along a motorcycle track, ford the Public Service Canal and 
then walk south eastwards toward Aurora 7 school.
