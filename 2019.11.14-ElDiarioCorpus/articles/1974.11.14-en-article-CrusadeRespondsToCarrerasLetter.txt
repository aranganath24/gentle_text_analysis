Crusade responds to Carreras letter
October 23, 1974 El Diario de La Gente c/o Editor UMC 416 University of Colorado Boulder, Colorado 80302 Attn: Miguel Carreras Real Heavy, Miguel: You are to be commended by Movement divisionists and agitators alike. But then some people Find it easier to take out | hostilities on their own familias I and companeros then on their enemies. In response to your all talk and no work comment, Miguel, it doesn’t take too much effort to pick up a telephone or visit the organizations and people you questioned in your letter to get answers. And may we suggest that when you write an open letter of criticism you let us all know how you qualify that criticism by letting us all know the example you have set For instance, let us know that you’ve been at all Movement activists' trials like those of Peralta and Roybal, Ernesto Vigil, Louis Ramirez, Brian Sanchez, Mario Vasquez, the Brighton 14, Chuck Koehler, Jose Calderon, Gary Garrison, Juan Avila, and the many others and how you’ve helped organize support for all these trials. Criticism is welcome, Miguel, but not when it comes out of your ass. Or it could be that you intend to cause Movement divisionism, antagonism, and misunderstand- 1 ing. For that counter-revolutionary crime, surely “ignorance is no excuse.” By the way, Miguel, (or anyone! else who has questions about the | Crusade for Justice), feel free to I come visit us (we work out of the j C.F.J. Bldg, at 1567 Downing in Denver) or call us at 832-1145 to discuss your criticism or, questions, or better yet, get involved with us. Trabajadores at The Crusade for Justice
