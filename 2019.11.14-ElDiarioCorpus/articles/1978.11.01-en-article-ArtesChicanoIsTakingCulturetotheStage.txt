Artes Chicano Is Taking Culture to the Stage

On the west coast of Aztlan, the new hit play “Zoot Suit" by Luis Valdez of Teatro Campesino is a smash hit, and in New York, Teatro 4 with their newest production “Give Me Five” are preparing to entertain, as well as educate, the world about Latinos in Los Barrios. But is the midwest left out? No way! The Artes Chicano dancers of Denver are bringing culture and beauty to Latinos who feel swallowed up by rock and roll or discomania. Enrique Montoya choreographs the dances performed by the troup that very well portrays significance and attitudes of the native peoples of America Central. The indepth research and cultural instinct give the performers the power to communicate the aesthetics of the indigenous tribes of

Mexico. Artes Chicano has 30 full time members and a conjunto known as El Group Aztlan. In 1975, the Chicano troup was known as Ballet Folklorico Netzahaulcoyotl and still better known for that name in some parts of Colorado. Some of their dance numbers include histories or legends from the states of Veracruz and the Yucatan Peninsula of Mexico. But the troups agility is not narrowed to the white vesture of the Veracruzana or the plush mosaic of the Yucatan but offers a repertoire of Latino heritage. The solemn peace and ocean magic of the Carribean Sea can only be as objects when described by words but in song and dance all things are alive. So thank you Artes Chicano for bringing culture back to life.
