DiManna Recall
Petitions Challenged
Robert Keating, attorney for Denver City Councilman Eugene (Geno) DiManna, has challenged all the signatures on petitions calling for a recall election. The Denver Election Commission will hear Keating's arguments Friday afternoon. Among the grounds challenging most or all of the /petitions are assertions that ‘ the original petitions filed Oct. 7 fail to name a committee of three persons as sponsors as required by the City Charter; that signers failed to take the required oath before a notary public that they were qualified electors, hadn't signed any other petition for the same purpose, were fully acquainted
with the subject matter of the petition and that they reside at the address accompanying their signatures. Because of other “irregularities," DiManna contends all petitions should be declared void on the grounds they are "permeated with fraud, deceit, and violations of the City Charter and ordinances." Sponsors of the recall filed additional petitions after petitions filed Oct. 7 were found to be lacking enough valid signatures for a recall election. The sponsors are confident that the petitions will be validated and that the recall election will be held.
