On January 29, 1973, at 11:30 a.m., Chicanos here at Greeley, Colorado marched to protest a "token" educational system which exists at Aims College. The march protested the Anglo controlled Aims College which keeps the Chicano suppressed with a "Special Needs" program.
Although there was a bomb threat which stated the bomb was to go off at I 1:30 a.m. the Chicano protesters marched on. Classes were dismissed because of the bomb threat, but for some unknown reason the College administrators remained in the buildings. The Chicanos then decided to picket the College until administrators met with them. Finally at 1:30 p.m. a negotiating meeting was held, during which Chicanos presented their demands. The main demands called for the reinstallation of Jose Calderon, the hiring of Chicano teachers, counsellors, and administrators. Chicanos also requested the "Special Needs Department" label be changed to Community Services. A week long fast was held in accordance with the protest. Chicanos are not afraid to suffer in order to save our "culture" and we are ready to give up everything in our fight for social justice in the colleges. "We have got to get off our knees and start fighting." Randy Esquibel, Greeley, Colorado
