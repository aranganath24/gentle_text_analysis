Time to clear the air

"Some of the flowers in our garden are turning into weeds," Al Vigil told his fellow members of the UMAS Board of Directors Monday. He was referring to the students dissatisfaction and - disappointments with the UMAS-EOP operation. Nothing can be resolved in El Diario, nor is it the place, but if there are bitches and gripes in the minds of students they should be brought to either the weekly UMAS Board meetings or the General Assembly meetings held twice a month. The strength of a strong organization is to learn from criticism. Rumors can only hurt let’s stop the talk. If we have complaints, questions, suggestions or misunderstandings let’s discuss them at an open forum. UMAS - EOP is here to serve the students, therefore it must be responsible to the needs of the students. But the students also have the responsibility to inform the administrators of their needs. UMAS General Assembly will meet next Wednesday
