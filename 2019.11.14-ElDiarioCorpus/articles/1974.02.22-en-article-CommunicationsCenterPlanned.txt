Communications Center plannedHermanas y Hermanos: I feel that in order to understand the needs of our people, there is a need to compile information based on facts. This information must be obtain through research in the cities and communities which Chicanos live. My desire to fulfill this need of knowledge is present now with the help of the Research Clearinghouse, created by interested students here at C.U. We have now submitted over 70 letters to establish a form of communication with various organizations. If there is any relevant information you would like to give for Carnalos y Carnales, we would appreciate this in attempt of seeing our aspirations become realities. We now have a limited resource material at the present time on Chicano and Migrant workers. If you need any information, we will try to obtain the material for the cost of xeroxing, which is 5c per page. If you are interested in what we are trying to do, please contact us at: Minority research Clearinghouse c/o Mike S. Garcia 1300 30th El 22 Boulder, Colo. 80302
