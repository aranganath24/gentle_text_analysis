Day care center planned
There have been many verbal requests from the University community for a University sponsored day care center. Many parents are in need of more free time to pursue individual interests; yet, are faced with the dilemma of where to leave their children. Of foremost importance, is an adequate child development center interested in individuals, providing an enriching and creative program, located at a convenient location, and inexpensive. Many parents are not presently satisfied with their present situation because of such reasons as cost, inadequacy, or low standards. The Child Development Center Project has been working on a proposal to fulfill those individual needs of the community and to provide a unique, stimulating environment for children. For the last two weeks, the center has been distributing a survey to assess those needs in the community, and to determine the extensiveness of interest among staff, faculty, and student parents. We regret that we couldn't send out the surveys to each individual family. However, they have been distributed to various departmental offices and locations on campus, the library, family housing, etc. We are very disappointed at student parents for their lack of interest in participating in this survey. The day care center is contingent on the outcome of this survey. The deadline date will be extended until Monday, February 26, and surveys may still be picked up at the Human Relations Center (UMC), in room 231 (UMC), or by calling ext. 6957.
