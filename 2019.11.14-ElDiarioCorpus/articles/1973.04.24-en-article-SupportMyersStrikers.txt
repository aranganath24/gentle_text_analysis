Support Myers’ StrikersStrikers at the Myers Company are continuing their efforts to beat management at the Myers plant, a Coors subsidiary. Although the National Labor Relations Board has ruled that the Myers' strikers were justified in striking, the local NLRB must now rule on the strike. Community solidarity with the workers is the only way Coors can be beaten. The Coors Company is totally against worker organization and labor unions, and has continually harassed the strikers. “Coors is applying all sorts of pressure to the Board to try and break the strike,” one of the strikers said, “and they’re so powerful in Colorado that they might succeed.” Coors won’t succeed if the entire community will join in supporting the Myers’ strikers. The strikers need help in picketing and in other tasks, so talk to the workers at the Myers’ plant, 34th and Walnut. The strikers will win with your support.
