The greatest achievement of the Chicano members of the senate and executive is the influence they had on the funding of all minority organizations in comparison to the amount of funding granted before the Chicano influence in ASUC. UMAS, for example, is now receiving $7715 for the 1973 school year, when they had received only $5143 the previous year, an increase of $2572. MACHO, another minority students organization, is now receiving $l9lO, a noticeable increase from their previous allotment. The Farm Labor Task Force is allotted $2372.39 for the next school year, an increase of close to $BOO. The Migrant Action Program has been allotted $2033 for the upcoming year, and the Chicano Law Students, who had not been receiving any funding, is now receiving $1428. Budget allotments are not the only area the Chicano senators and executive have shown their influences. The nationwide head lettuce boycott has achieved great progress on the CU campus because of their work and backing.The ASUC lettuce boycott committee has obtained 2159 signatures from dormitory residents on petitions demanding the University serve only UFW head lettuce or provide alternatives. As a result of ASUC’s action, the university is now observing a total boycott of head lettuce. The administration feels that this places them in a neutral position in the dispute between the UFW and the Teamsters Union. Tri-executive Jess Vigil has been working on his own project since his election to the Associated Students of the University of Colorado. He has organized the Colorado Minorities Council in an attempt to create unity between the various minority organizations throughout Colorado campuses. The theme for this years’ Chicano ASUC officials seems to be community awareness, both by more communityoriented events and more interaction between Chicano students and the university community.
