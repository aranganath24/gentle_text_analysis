Coors denied renewed sales in student center
On Sept. 4, the University of Colorado Student Union (UCSU) renewed the prohibition of Coors beer in the Boulder Campus student center. UCSU was pressured by more than 70 backers of the boycott to kill a bill which proposed that the students vote on the issue. Two weeks previous, the UMC (student center) board voted 5-4 in favor of bringing in Coors. That voted needed UCSU ratification to become effective. Coors has not been sold in the UMC since Dec. 3, 1968, when CU students voted to ban its sales there because of Coors policies, not only on labor, but of Joseph Coors activities as a C.U. regent. According to Fred Trujillo, a leading critic of Coors, "Joseph Coors didn't want 'dirty meskins, niggers, japs or women to attend school at CU'–and that's precisely the type of lingo that he used." WHY BOYCOTT COORS BF.F.R? Coors did not gain notoriety from Joseph Coors' regent actions only. In 1968, the Colorado G.l. Forum began the first Coors boycott by Chicanos because of complaints the company discriminates against Chicanos, Blacks and women. Ten years later, the Equal Employment Opportunity Council (EEOC) filed suit (Civil Action 75-992) based on the same complaint. For Joseph, William, Adolph IV and Peter Coors, owners of Colorado's largest private-owned employment base, that was only the beginning. Other charges followed: 
*Adolph Coors Co. has been convicted by the Federal Trade Commission for wholesale and retail price fixing, illegal anti-competitive practices, illegal territorial requirements on distributorships and illegal methods to coerce draft beer accounts. 
*Adolph Coors Co. was ordered by the Colorado Health Department on Dec. 4, 1975, to stop dumping waste into a gulch north of Golden that feeds into several livestock ponds.
*October 1968, C.U. students voted to censure Joseph Coors for his "intimidatory approach" to University Pres. Joseph Smiley. 
*November 1968, 17 labor unions went on strike against the Adolph Coors Brewery. 
*In 1969, the National Student Association at the National Student Congress decided to support the Coors Boycott because of claims of student harassment. 
ïIn August, 1970, the Colorado Civil Rights Commission ruled that Adolph Coors Co. was guilty of racial discrimination in the 1969 firing of a black employee. 
*In August, 1974, in his last day as President, Richard Nixon nominated Joseph Coors to serve on the board of the Corporation for Public Broadcasting. 13 months later, the U.S. Senate Commerce Committee rejected the nomination and also asked Coors to resign as director of Television News Inc., but he refused. 
*In July, 1975, the 10th Circuit Court of Appeals ruled that Adolph Coors Co. owed $5.1 million in back taxes to the U.S. Government. The company was also found guilty of understating its income for 1965 and 1966. 
*On June I, 1976. Adolph Coors Co. was fined $4,000 by the Colorado Water Quality Control Commission for violating water pollution laws. Coors discharged excessive solid brewery waste into an irrigation ditch used by Broomfield and Westminster residents for drinking water. 

THE POLITICIANS BEHIND THE BEER 
According to a February, 1975, Denver Post article, Joseph Coors said he supported some of the "thought" and ideas of the radical right-wing John Birch Society and "at times supported them with funds." Other political scenes of Coors include: 
*Joseph Coors admitted to contributing at least $l,000 to Ronald Reagan's 1976 presidential-bid campaign. He added that he paid for full-page advertisements in Florida newspapers to aid Reagan in the primary there. That year, Coors described Reagan as "the man who can lead us back." 
*Many Chicanos in Denver have grown more concerned about Coors' practices because of his providing the Denver Police Department with helicopters to patrol their barrios.
*An editorial printed last month in the Daily, by Dave Anderson, states, 'that until 1972, not a single woman was employed in the brewery department. The article added that Joseph Coors has boasted his opposition to ERA (Equal Rights Amendment). 
*In the early seventies, when Cesar Chavez and the UFW's grape boycott was gaining world-wide attention, Coors trucks broke picket lines to transport the fruit. 
*Coors' porcelain plant in Golden, Colo, has added a new dimension to the Coors brothers' political scene. The plant makes nuclear weapon parts for the military. In 1975, at Phipps Tennis House in Denver, the local Young Republicans nominated Joseph Coors as their "1975 Man of the Year." Chicano students from C.U. attended the party from the outside, naming Coors "pig of the year."

UNION BUSTING
According to William Coors. president of the brewery, the oldest strike dales back to 1960 by the International Brothers of Electrical Workers. On May 9. 1977, when he made that statement, there were technically 15 unions on strike at Coors. According to current strikers of Coors (Brewery Workers local 366 of Golden), the company uses lie detector (polygraph) testing on employees. Questions such as political affiliation, sex habits and arrest records arc included in the test. Search and seizure tactics are also used by the brewery to "weed out those who stand up for their rights," claims the union. That includes physical examinations, by Coors employed doctors, at any time. 

HEALTH RESERVATIONS 
Coors beer is not pasteurized. Instead the company filters the beer, three separate times, through cotton fiber Enzinger pads which contain asbestos. Recent studies indicate that, if inhaled, asbestos causes cancer. Laboratories arc currently trying to determine if it causes cancer when ingested orally. In the viewpoint of many minorities and working-class people, the Coors foundation may not only be the richest private estate in Colorado, it may very well be the most powerfully dangerous.
More than 70 persons, mostly Chicanos, voiced their opposition to Coors.
