UMAS fed up with politicosAfter careful study of the campus political arena, and testimony of past senators and executive, U.M.A.S. decided not to run candidates in the ASUC elections this spring. UMAS has determined the ASUC to be a farce. We know many will say, “You made it a farce", “You were part of that farce” or “it can work” nonsense. The university administration connived and created the ASUC to have students wasting their time, running campaigns against each other, and spending an impotent year. Meanwhile the administrators sit back and enjoy the game. The only thing the university administration respects is confrontation. A good example of this, is the recent "study-in” at the library. I An integral part of our decision is that we will put our efforts into taking lettuce off campus. We realize that the lettuce referendum is illegal; however, we also realize that the farmworkers need our help more than ever, so we will vote for no lettuce. The University administration can and does ignore ASUC at will I and can negate any ASUC decision. UMAS has real responsibilities that we can not ignore and we cannot support a farce.
