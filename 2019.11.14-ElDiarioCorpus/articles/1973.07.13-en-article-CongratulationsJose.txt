Congratulations, Jose!

El Diario congratulates and commends Jose Ortega, who will end his term as UMAS board of directors chairman this Monday, for his tremendous service and aid to La Raza during the last year. Jose has kept the UMAS organization working on a number of fronts, and has placed his personal life aside for his work on the Farm Labor Task Force, the UMAS organization, and in all endeavors involving the betterment of Chicanos. Jose has continually been the first to appear on picket lines and the last to leave for a well-earned rest, and is known statewide for his selfless dedication to the farmworkers. He continues to serve as a role-model for all those who would call themselves Chicano, for he is one man whose actions speak louder than his words. Jose, more than any other individual, is responsible for the great advances made by the UMAS organization during the past year. We salute you, Jose, for a job well done.
