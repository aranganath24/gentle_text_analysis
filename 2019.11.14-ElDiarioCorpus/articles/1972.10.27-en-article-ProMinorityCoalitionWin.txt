Pro-Minority Coalitions Win
After a tremendous showing in the ASUC Senate primaries last week, candidates from the pro-minority and New Direction Coalition groups scored an upset win over Peter Solomon’s Dollar Ticket candidates. The united candidates won all nine Arts and Sciences Senate seats, and made solid gains in other important areas. The only “Break Solomon's Chain” candidate who failed to get a Senate seat was Gary Smith, who was hampered in his efforts by a late campaign start. Final vote counts were
greeted by jubilant shouts from the two winning groups, while Dollar Ticket candidates expressed somewhat less enthusiastic reactions. “We’re back on the road towards equality," said Dave Madrid, as it became certain that Solomon’s group was falling behind. “It seems that the students are tired of personal political ambitions being given priority over the problems we’re facing at CU,” he added. Nancy Sechrist, one of the defeated Dollar Ticket candidates, said that she would
not pay student fees in a highly charged statement made as the pro-Solomon group fell steadily behind.
In related news, the campaign was marked by several incidents of questionable political tactics. BSC and NDC posters were ripped from walls on campus, boxes of the chicano newspaper “El Diario de la Gente" were stolen, and anti-minority supporters even went so far as to charge minority candidates with plotting to make courses in Mexican-American history mandatory for all students.
