A documentary aired recently on channel 9 KBTV, depicted Antonito as a poor community. In the perspective of a materialist, it is. The people from the area have a richness which is totally unique, its beauties lie within the knowledge that the people understand each other. The documentary depicted Antonito as an impoverished area, with may disadvantaged people. This statement in itself is an adequate discription, but to those who see themselves as being from a city, the life that Antonito offers is one of fresh air and the absence of the rat-race which exists, and to many people in Antonito the simple life is all that is important. It seems apparent the telecast served its purpose, in that soon after, donations started coming into the community. The visible problem it seems was not touched on at all. The problem being that gifts and donations dont help the people for very long. Donations and gifts are appreciated, but what is needed is a means by were the people can succeed on there own. Means which would create jobs which are so badly needed. The problem that Antonito has is one that is not peculiar to Antonito, but is characteristic of many towns in the southern part of the Valley. It is very ironic that the aid that comes in the form of grants is never put to use in the right forms, and most of the aid .that does come in helps to support a local tourist attraction. Being from a small community means, many times being unaware of the outside world. This has been the case with the people of the Southern part of the San Luis Valley. The people means have changed from small community framing and ranching to outside land companies whose interests lie in the profits. The inner beauties which lie within a small community and its people can only be perceived by those who live it.
