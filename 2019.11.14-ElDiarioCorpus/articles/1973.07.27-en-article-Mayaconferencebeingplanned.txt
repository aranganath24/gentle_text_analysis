Maya conference being planned

UMAS is tentatively planning a fiesta as a joint celebration of the Mexican American Youth Adelante (MAYA) Conference combined with the 16 de Septiembre celebration September 14-16. The MAYA conference serves as a recruiting effort to attract high school students, adults, veterans, and other Chicanos to attend the University under the UMAS and Migrant Action Program (MAP) Educational Opportunity Programs (EOP). The 16 de Septiembre is celebrated annually to mark the anniversary of Mexicoâ€™s independence from Spain. According to a fiesta coordinator, Eileen Torrez, the purpose of combining both events is to provide a Chicano cultural environment and to help promote a better understanding of Chicano student activities and education at the University. Although funding for the fiesta is also tentative, it is proposed to have the joint celebration funded through the UMAS Organization in conjunction with Cultural Events Board (CEB) and UMAS-EOP. and UMAS-EOP. UMAS expects approximately 3000-4000 people to attend the MAYA conference, in addition to those people are who expected at the fiesta. Students attending the MAYA conference will be housed and fed during the entire stay, although housing locations have not been confirmed. Workshops and booths relevant to the Chicano student will be set up as part of the fiesta with information on admissions, financial aid, supportive services, and housing. Entertainment and main events are already in progress for the fiesta. Speakers, cultural dancers, singers, group discussions, games, food, and booths displaying information relevant to our Chicano culture, are all part of the tentative plans. Volunteers are needed to help with the fiesta planning. All ideas and suggestions are welcomed. All interested volunteers should attend the meetings at 6:00 in Nichols Hall, every Tuesday evening.
