Danny Vasquez Not Forgotten

On January 22, 1978, seventeen-year-old Danny Vasquez was shot and killed by a county sheriff’s deputy in El Paso, Texas. According to the Danny Vasquez Justice Committee, the youth was shot after he approached Deputy Guzman to give information about a fight that previously occurred. Vasquez was unarmed and apparently shot and killed in cold blood. According to the autopsy, the youth did not die instantly, but no effort was made by police to get him medical

attention. Many minorities, especially Chicanos, have been killed by police. Police crime is covered up by authorities and most police are acquitted of homicide charges. March 8, 1978 the El Paso County Grand Jury labeled Guzman’s actions “Justifiable Homicide.” Concerned members of the community and parents have sought further investigation into the slaying of Danny, but as of yet have received no assistance. Letters sent to the Governor, to the Attorney General, to the President of the United States and to many more officials have been unresponsive. A campaign was started to combat and stop atrocities and crimes by police. As long as police crime goes unpunished, innocent people will continue to be victims of unwarranted police brutality. Send letters of protest to the Attorney General Griffin Bell and demand further investigation into the Vasquez incident. Danny Vasquez’s death and many like his must not be in vain!
