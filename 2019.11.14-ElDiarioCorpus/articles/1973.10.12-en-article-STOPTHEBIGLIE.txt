STOP THE BIG LIE! FINANCIAL AID MUST SERVE THE STUDENTS! Financial aid-a legacy 
of frustration: Have you ever had to stand in slowly-moving lines for an NDSL check that 
wasn't there? Have you ever had to beg for a short-term loan because your carefully-prepared 
financial aid forms were lost? We are now five weeks into the semester, and many students who 
were promised financial aid have not received a penny! Many other students have been given 
inadequate aid, and their needs and the needs of their families have not been met. Students 
have spent hours in lines; have missed classes, and many more have left the University bitterly 
disappointed because the University does not provide for efficient, equitable financial aid. These 
problems are not new. The administration has refused to act on complaints from individual 
students, and the low-income students are suffering because of that lack of University response. 
In view of this intolerable situation, WE DEMAND: — additional staff for Jerry Soliz and the office 
of financial aid — additional office space and facilities for financial aid use — a computer 
specifically for financial aid use — that all acceptance/declination forms and notifications of 
financial aid be distributed by Friday — an end to the practice of disenrolling Chicanos who 
allegedly owe the University money. JOIN US IN A MARCH AND RALLY!!! TODAY: Oct. 3 
TIME: 1:00 P.M. PLACE: UMC Fountain Area
