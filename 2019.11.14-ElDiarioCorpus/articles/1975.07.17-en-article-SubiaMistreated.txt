Subia mistreated and in need of help
Hector Subia is 31 years old and is serving a six to fourteen year sentence for armed robbery and assault. He is an active member of LADS and Chicano Studies. In September of 1974, he was suffering from pains in his stomach and the prison doctor sent him to Colorado State Hospital in Pueblo for appendectomy. Later it was found out that there was nothing wrong with his appendix so the doctor at the prison told him he had liver, kidney, heart trouble and also terminal syphilis. Hector’s private physician, diagnosed as simple urinary tract infection that was never taken care of at the prison because of inadequate medical attention. Hector was transferred to Medium Security (M.S.) in the Spring of ’75, the administration supposedly busted him for an overdose of heroin. When he was taken to the prison hospital he was pronounced dead. Other medical personnel diagnosed it as adverse reaction to home-brew. A kangaroo court was set up by the
administration to charge Hector with illegal use of heroin and contraband. Subia has earned a reputation in the prison as an anti-drug activist, when he demanded legal representation, he was drugged physically to Cell House 7. The pigs say he could leave Cell House 7, but Hector refuses to beg the pigs, cause he does not consider himself guilty. The guards also hung a “snitch jacket" on him so other inmates would try to kill him. His physical condition has worsened because of the lack of medical treatment he has been a target of racial slurs and physical harassment, his life is in constant danger because of the “snitch jacket". Hector has grown strong and proven that his spirit will not be broken. The prison doctor is having him transferred today to Colorado State Hospital where it is very likely that Hector will go through an intense Behavior Modification Program and physical and mental torture.
