Give Mateski the axe!
It has been rumored that Dennis Mateski applied to be a Nixon hatchetman and help with the dismantling of the Office of Economic Opportunity. When he was soundly rejected he decided to take his hatchet to University ASUC. He began his Last Campaign for the ASUC executive office with a promise to begin immediate decentralization of the body. Since winning the primaries, he has changed his Last Campaign to a more moderate restructuring plan which he feels will win him the votes necessary to win. Mr. Mateski, we still like to think of your campaign as your last campaign, for in our opinion you have blown your credibility at this campus. How come when it was an all-White ASUC Senate, you rightwing reactionaries had no thoughts of dissolving ASUC? Now that Chicanos, Blacks and women are gaining positions in the senate, it is time to dissolve it. 1 must question your integrity if you choose to practice your racism on a computer card rather than on the forum floor. We urge all persons who truly want a representative government to vote a New Directions ticket today and tomorrow.
