Puerto Rican nationalists released from U.S. prisons
After having been freed, the four Puerto Rican nationalists have promised to continue fighting to liberate Puerto Rico from North American domination. The four nationalists spent almost twenty-five years in prison for having perpetuated an attack against the Senate and for having made an attempt on the life of President Harry Truman. Also freed was Oscar Collazo who declared upon leaving prison: “the light for freedom is always a long action and the fight is also arduous.” Collazo said that Truman was a human being and “I didn’t shoot against him but against the system which he represented, now the circumstances are different. But I don’t repent, I think it was something we had to do.” Lolita Lcbron, Irving Flores Rodriguez, Rafael Cancel Miranda and Oscar Collazo
returned to Puerto Rico where groups of sympathizers awaited them unfurling the black Hag of the Nationalist party and that of Puerto Rico. “I feel a great satisfaction we have triumphed in our struggle,” said Lolita. She also said that she and her companions fell “stronger than ever, more compromised than ever,” to make the Independence of Puerto Rico a reality. On the other hand the governor of the island, Carlos Romero Barcclo, who openly supports Puerto Rico becoming another state of the U.S. said that the liberation of the four nationalists could have an impact in the elections to be held next year. He also declared that the tics between Puerto Rico and the United States will solidify more if the presence of the nationalists generates violence.
