BEOG begins in September

Incoming UMAS-EOP freshmen are being mailed an application form for a new type of financial aid plan being partially implemented for this school year. According to Jerry Soliz, assistant director of Financial Aid, the Basic Economic Opportunity Grant EOG) will be awarded to incoming freshmen this fall in amounts no greater than $14OO per school year. "All college students will be allowed to apply for a BEOG, and once you are certified as eligible, you must receive at least $50,” Soliz said. Since only a limited amount of funds were appropriated for the program, a reduction scale will determine how much a student actually receives. If the number of applicants exceeds the amount of money available, grants will be reduced accordingly. A student who is eligible for $14OO, the maximum amount one student can receive each school year, will compete with students whose need is only $lOO. The student who needs for $1OOO to $14OO a school year will have his grant reduced by no more than 25 percent if there aren’t enough funds to help all eligible students. If 10,000 students are deemed eligible for $1OO grants, students who need $14OO could have their grant reduced to pay those higher income students with less need the $1OO they qualify for. Conceivably, the BEOG program could end up funding many more rich students with $1OO needs than poor students with $ 1400 needs. Also, only continuing and former students will be eligible for the Supplemental Educational Opportunity Grant (SEOG). “The guidelines for the BEOG are still somewhat hazy, and the program has not yet been entirely explained," Soliz said. He noted that both National Defense Student Loan and Work-study jobs will be available to incoming freshmen, though.
