'Spanish, heart of our beautiful culture’
We Chicanos should realize that our Spanish language is the heart and soul of our beautiful heritage and culture. When, and if, it should become a dead language, then our Chicano culture and "raza” as we now know them and are so proud of, will also die and we will have lost our Chicano identity that we are now fighting so hard to retain. Our Spanish language is perhaps the most important distinguishing trait that we have. This, more than anything else, helps to unify all Chicanos in a common cause, the anvancement of all our “raza.” If we are truly proud of our heritage, and if we are truly dedicated to our Chicano brothers, then we as future Chicano leaders should dedicate ourselves to learn and speak the language which proudly and honorably exemplifies our Chicano culture. Even though they failed to teach us, our parents want us to know and speak our language. Granted that any foreign language is hard to learn, but now every Chicano student here has the opportunity, not only to learn, but also to use it every day. It is not so important that we speak Spanish perfectly, but rather that we begin to master it, so that it can be used as an effective tool in the advancement and pride of our “raza”. We owe it, not only to our ancestors, but also to ourselves and to those generations of beautiful Chicanos yet to be born, to help perpetuate the tremendous pride and honor we feel when we say, “¡Viva la Raza!” ¡VIVA LA RAZA!
