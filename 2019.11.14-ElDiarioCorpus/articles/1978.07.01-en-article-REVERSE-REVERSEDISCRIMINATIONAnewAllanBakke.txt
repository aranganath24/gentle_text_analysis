REVERSE-REVERSE DISCRIMINATIONA new Allan BakkeWashington D.C. ¡ªAnother Allen Bakke has come out of the woodwork this week. His name is Brian Weber. But Weber's court challenge poses a new threat to affirmative action. The white Louisiana factory worker sued The Kaiser Aluminum & Chemical Co. in Gramercy, La. after the company sought to aid blacks in some crafts by training an equal number of blacks to whites until black representation reached 39 percent. He was denied the training and subsequently filed the reverse discrimination suit.A U.S'. Court of Appeals ruled 2-1 in New Orleans last November that an employer who has not actually discriminated against blacks violates the law by preferring blacks for job openings. Last month the Federal Supreme Court Justice Lewis Powell mentioned that an employer can have an all white work force if he has not ¡°intentionally¡± discriminated against ¡°the Negro." The U.S. Appellate Court may therefore have submerged a "Reverse-reverse discrimination¡± precedent. The Equal EmploymentOpportunity Commission officials say affirmative action programs won't be slowed by the Supreme Court ruling that Bakke was a victim of reverse discrimination. EEOC attorneys say the agency still can give preference to minorities and women to correct past job discrimination. EEOC chairwoman Eleanor Norton contends that if the Weber ruling stands, employers may stop undertaking voluntary affirmative actions. If that happens, ¡°the whole law enforcement system in antidiscrimination has gone berserk," she said.
