Badly burned

A carnal of ours is in the hospital; a camping stove exploded on his body. He has third-
degree burns all over his body. It would be nice if our carnales and carnalas would send 
him a “get well soon” card, and write to him at the following information; Vernon 
Johnson, Brooks General Hospital, 4th floor room No. 14-A Fort Sam Houston, Texas 
78108. Vernon is a brother of Ben Romero an U.M.A.S. student. Everything done will be 
greatly appreciated.
