Books steering Chicano children wrong
Chicano children are obtaining a decidedly negative and interior self-image from fiction and nonfiction books about Chicanos. according to the Council on Interracial Books for Children. A survey of 200 books dealing with Chicanos found that the books don't present Chicano culture the way it is. but instead deteriorate a child's sense of pride in his culture and language, leaving him with a sense of dependency and helplessness. A two-year study of the books by Chicano educators, specialists in childrenâ€™s literature and faculty
members of Chicano studies programs reported that because many of the books are written byAnglos the books fail to be relevant to Chicano experience. According to the report, the Anglo writers consistently used stereotypic symbols to identify Chicano culture and people", such as figures under brimmed hats asleep beneath a cactus, serapes, pinatas. burros, and broken english. The characters in the books never struggle against their problems, such as poverty but live with them. "The causes of poverty
are never discussed, real anger against the economic and political discrimination which lie at the root of Chicano poverty is completely ignored." the report said. Instead the books leave the image that Mexicans and Chicanos are quaint, ignorant and inferior and that the Anglo way of life is undoubtedly superior, the report said. "Chicano helplessness and passivity are contrasted with Anglo's charitable good nature and effectiveness."
