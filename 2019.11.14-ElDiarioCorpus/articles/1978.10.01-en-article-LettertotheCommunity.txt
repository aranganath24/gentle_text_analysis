Letter to the CommunityRecently a story entitled ¡°Migrant workers frustrate minority boss¡± was printed in a Denver newspaper. The character in this particular article can be paralled to Allen Bakke, ¡°innocent victim¡± of so called reverse discrimination. Bakke tributcd his non-entry to medical school to the minority class. He was very successful at demeaning facts and clouding the issue. Nevertheless his tactic was obvious to use the people as scapegoats to gain personal feats. Mike Mizokami, portrayed in the recent article as "humble¡± blantely blames the migrant workers for his own fallacies. Three weeks ago a labor camp owned by Mizokami was closed down in Blanca Colorado by health officials. Living conditions are hazardous and unfit for people to inhabit. Instead of accepting responsibility for his own inadequate housing facilities, Mizokami shifts the blame to innocent people. He unwarrantly charges that the migrants are ¡°people who would rather act like pigs¡±. This charge is merely Mizokami¡¯s way of scapegoating. If he is as ¡°humble¡± as is portrayed why does he pay only the minimum wage for the back breaking hard labor? Instead of small ¡°chozas¡± why does Mizokami not build liveable housing complexes for the workers? Why does he so eagerly seek to downgrade a people for his own wrongs? Mizokami does not want to be the suspect, so he tries to turn the table and make the workers the suspects. ¡°Pig¡± means greed and it is evident that Mizokami himself possesses this characteristic. While workers toil hard in the fields to survive, Mizokami lives quite comfortably. He¡¯s like a vulcan living off the people¡¯s work. Mizokami claims ¡°all I¡¯ve ever done is work hard¡±, and it is true, all Mizokami ever has done is work hard at degrading and oppressing migrant workers. He is close-minded, he sees himself as a martyr, yet at the same time he bleeds the people.
