Make Boulder your barrio. Tom Trujillo of University Admissions and Records said last Saturday that recruitment of new UMAS-EOP students is progressing smoothly for the 1974-75 academic year. However, there are still slots for those Chicanos who are thinking of coming to college beginning either this summer or fall. The fact that Chicano students are now being admitted in large numbers to the University is not easy to appreciate unless you know the hassles Chicanas used to be subject to when applying for college. For example, one of my friends graduated in the lowest 25. of our high school graduating class of 450, yet he was able to be admitted to the 1969 summer program, an impossibility 10 years ago. Not enough emphasis has been placed on recruiting all kinds of Chicanos to the University, including GED students, veterans, married Chicanos & Chicanas, and those who graduated from high school years ago. All of these people should be told about the opportunities at the University and be given a chance to come to school. One of the best-times to recruit new University Chicanos will be the spring break vacation period, March 23 - 30. If you return to your community you can get in touch with some of the people I’ve mentioned. For example, in Pueblo I know several friends who are now working in the steel mill there who would probably want to hear more about the summer program and the supportive services we have at the University. Do the same when you go home this weekend. Ask your younger brothers and sisters about graduating Chicano seniors who might not know about the chances they have to attend college. Hit up your older friends and see what they’re doing now. If you’ll do just this little task for your Raza, you might help 10 of your brothers whom someone you recruited was able to help. “The circle will be unbroken” if you extend your hand to a hometown hermano.
