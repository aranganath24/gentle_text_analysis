Farmworkers leave fieldsBulletin Eight thousand farm workers under Teamster contracts walked out of the lettuce and asparagus fields of the Imperial Valley Monday Feb. 18. The work stoppage was called to protest the Teamsters’ “sweetheart” contracts with California growers. At press time, we understand at least 1,000 workers have carried the work stoppage throughout the week. Cesar Chavez, president of the rival union, the United Farm Workers of America, called for the work stoppage to demonstrate that although the workers have been forced to work under Teamster contracts they still support the UFW.In a Los Angeles Times story, Teamster officials explained the large number of workers out of the fields “they’re out because of George Washington’s birthday.” The Teamster contracts do not recognize Washington’s birthday as a legal holiday. During the work stoppage, 16 workers have been arrested. Most have been charged with minor unlawful assembly charges, but at least two were arrested and charged for allegedly assaulting police officers. Supporters of the union are asked to send letters to protest the police action to Sheriff Owen Fox, Imperial County Courthouse, El Centro, California
