Bienvenidos
On behalf of the Migrant Action Program (MAP) student body staff and counselors, I would like to extend a warm
welcome to all new MAP students to the University of Colorado. I would, also, like to encourage all MAP students to get involved in their programâ€™s activities. All suggestions and recommendations will be appreciated. I feel that our program should be run on a better organized manner. Due to the structure of our program, decisions are not made solely by myself or staff, but by the MAP student body. Everything we do will be planned, organized and directed. Students please visit the MAP office (Willard Hall) at least once a week and let us know of any problems you may have. We will attempt to help you solve them before it is too late. There is a daily schedule posted in the MAP office with an abundance of program activities. Augustine O. Cordova Student Director
