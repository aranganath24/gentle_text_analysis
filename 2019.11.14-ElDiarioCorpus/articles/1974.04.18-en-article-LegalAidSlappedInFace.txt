Legal Aid slapped in faceOnce again the poor people of Metropolitan Denver have been coldly slapped in the face as a result of the Nixon Administration's de-emphasis on social welfare programs. As of Monday, April first, the Denver Legal Aid Society cut it’s legal services to the poor to an "emergencies only” basis. The Legal Aid Society immediately cut it's caseload because of a decision by the Nixon Administration to terminate Model Cities funding, who in turn fund Legal Aid. This “low Blow” by the Nixon administration will have a tremendous impact on the poor people who live in the Denver area. Those currently on welfare will probably be effected more so than anyone else. With the high cost of living, which is constantly increasing, welfare recipients are barely able to purchase food stamps and pay their rent; much less hire an attorney. For example: According to a local attorney referral service, a one-half hour conference with an attorney will cost ten dollars. As of April first, the Denver Legal Aid office will except only uncontested divorce cases. If for some reason the divorce is contested, the legal aid client will have to make arrangements to hire a private attorney. A private attorney bandleing a contested divorce case will charge approximately two hundred and fifty dollars. The poor shouldn't have to pay these ridiculously high attorney lees. Cutting Legal Aid funds is a classic example of the Nixon Administration's efforts to save the tax dollar. Unfortunately these tax dollars aren't saved and used for something constructive, but are used to send men to the moon, make bigger and better bombs, etc. No thanks Mr. Nixon, the poor didn't need that slap across the face. What they need is their money in the community where it will do some good. Now they will become poorer and you will become richer.
