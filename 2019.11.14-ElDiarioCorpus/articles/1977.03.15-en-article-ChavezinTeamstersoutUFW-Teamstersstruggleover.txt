Chavez in, Teamsters out UFW-Teamsters struggle over!
The United Farm Workers (UFW) and their 10-year adversary, the Teamsters Union, have signed an agreement that will leave all jurisdiction concerning contracts between growers and farm workers solely in the hands of the UFW. While this was a victory for the UFW, the boycott of head lettuce, grapes and Gallo wines still continues. This mutual pact contends that Teamsters will no longer organize workers for growers. The difficult task of growers and workers coming to contract agreements will now be left up to the UFW. UFW president Cesar Chavez and Western Teamsters leader M.E. Anderson signed the five year pact at the Teamsters Western headquarters in Burlingame, California. Chavez press secretary Marc Grossman told 7 Diario , "were very pleased with the agreement. It was a negotiated agreement. We didnt get everything we wanted, they didnt get everything they wanted.
When all current Teamster contracts expire in the summer of 1978, the union will deal only with cannery workers, farm truck drivers and other nonfield laborers. While the agreement only covers 13 Western states, Grossman said, negotiations will begin on a nationwide agreement. These negotiations begin in two years providing both sides show good faith. The settlement took months of secret negotiation. Both of us were fed up with fighting each other, Chavez said. Teamsters began organizing farm workers in 1961. Ten years passed before conflicts between unions began. In the following years a bitter, expensive and often violent war existed in attempts to gain the allegiance of farm workers in California and Arizona. The recent implementation of Californias new farm labor law however, has shown that the UFW is the farm workers choice in union elections.
