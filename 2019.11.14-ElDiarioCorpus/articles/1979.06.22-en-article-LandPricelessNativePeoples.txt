Land priceless to Native Peoples
The U.S. Court of Claim ruled 5 to 2 in a decision which would reimburse the Sioux Indian Tribe for land taken 100 years ago. The court decision which was made on June 13, stated that the Sioux are entitled to $17.5 million for their land and 5 percent interest dating back to the land seizure 102 years ago. The Court said the total setiment could reach $132.5 million dollars to be distributed between 60,000 Indians. This is not the first time that the question of compensation of the 7 million acre Black Hill area has come before the Court. In 1974, when the Indian Claims Commission awarded the Indians the money for the land plus interest. The Claim Court upheld the $17.5 million for land compensation but denied the Indians the interest payments. Congress ordered the Court last
year to reconsider, and this time the Claims Court found that the land was taken in violation of the Indians Constitutional Rights. That finding entitled the Native Americans to both land compensation and interest'. Native Americans who are related to the case find that the situation is awkward concerning the Sacred Black Hills. Elijah Whirlwind Horse, president of the Ogalala Sioux Tribe at Pine Ridge, said his Tribal Council feels “That the Sacred Black Hills are not for sale.” He added and showed concern that the money would go to the Washington lawyers who are arguing the case. Sioux attorney, Arthur Larfarus Jr. estimated it would amount to $lO5 million to go to 60,000 Indians thus implying that the Attorneys could make as much as $27.5 million for arguing the case.
