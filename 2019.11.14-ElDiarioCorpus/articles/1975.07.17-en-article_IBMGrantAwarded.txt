IBM grant awarded
Denver... A $36,000 grant to aid students in the cooperative minority Master of Business Administration (MBA) program at the University of Denver College of Business Administration has been made by International Business Machines Corp. (IBM). The grant will support at least two students a year for the next three years in the program.
The four-year-old program is an attempt to bolster representation of minorities, particularly Spanish-surnamed Americans in the Rocky Mountain and southwestern United States, in graduate business education, Dean Peter A. Firmin of the College of Business Administration said. A 1974 Ford Foundation report took special note of under-representation of Spanish-surnamed students in graduate and professional schools. The University of Denver program was launched in 1971 in cooperation with the Colorado Educational Development Association (CEDA), a federally funded minority education and training program, and the Colorado Migrant Council. The college felt it should devote part of its annual budget to insure the successful establishment of the program. Students in the program attend on a 12-month basis rather than the normal nine-month academic year. The $36,000 IBM grant will be used mostly for tuition expenses of additional students in the program during the next three years, with some of the money being used for book allowances, living stipends, and tutorial, program administration and student recruiting expenses. The continuation and growth of the program, however, require additional financial resources to support the growing number of interested and qualified students, Dean Firmin noted. To date, 33 students have enrolled in the program, Dean Firmin reported. Eleven have been graduated.
