Escuela Tlatelolco The weather is cold and the Escuela Tlatelolco, a Chicano school located at the Crusade for Justice, 16th & Downing, Denver, is in need of a heating system. The heating system in the building has given out but the school is functioning as normally as possible with the use of a portable heating system. The portable heating system however only heats part of the Crusade building. A new boiler system is needed and it will cost $20,000. Jose Gonzales, Principle of the school, said that the students are selling new copies of the book Rudolfo “Corky" Gonzales' “I am Joaquin" to raise money. The revenue from the book will be used to purchase a new boiler. Copies of the book can be bought in the El Diario office room 416 UMC
