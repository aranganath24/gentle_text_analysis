Movement newsFarahThe 21 -month-old strike by employees of the Farah manufacturing Company has ended, as William Farah announced Feb. 28 that he will begin bargaining with representatives of the Amalgamated Clothing Workers (AFL-CIO). Four Farah Pants plants had closed during the long and bitter strike, which began when Farah said he would not negotiate with workers who wanted Union representation. Most of the Farah workers are Chicanos, and they grew tired of the low wages Farah offered and the arbitrary firing of employees who failed to meet high production quotas. Several employees then began talking to other workers about organizing a union, and when Farah heard of their efforts, he fired the union organizers. Two-thirds of Farah’s employees went out on strike in solidarity with the fired employees. The strike gained momentum as the Catholic clergy endorsed first the strike, and later the boycott of Farah products that was called by union workers from the Amalgamated Clothing Workers. Farah lost money rapidly, and in 1972 showed a net loss of $8.3 million dollars in trade. In 1973 Farah shoed a profit of only $143,000, or one cent per share of Farah stock. The week following the announcement of the settlement was Farah’s most successful week on the New York Stock Exchange since the boycott began. The company’s stock closed at $10.50, up 31.3 per cent for the week.
