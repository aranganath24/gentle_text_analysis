NOTICE TO READERS
Western New Mexico University in Silver City, New Mexico, is in the process of selecting candidates for the position of president of the University. Chicano students on campus are expressing the need for the next university president to be a Chicano. According to Moviemento Estudiantil Chicano de Aztlan (MEChA) representatives, 45 percent of the students on campus are Chicanos. And 60 to 70 percent of the population of Silver City is Chicano. A need for a Chicano president at the University is obvious to Chicano students. Past administration has done little to promote the mobility of Chicano students, nor has it allowed for a full potential of student organization. Most of the advertising for this position has been done outside of the Southwest. The University is aiming at hiring a non-Chicano, as in the past. But the students from Western, want it to be known to all qualified Chicanos, that the position is open. Deadline for applications is March 31, 1980. Anyone interested should write to: c/o Presidential Search Committee Western New Mexico University Silver City, NM 88061
