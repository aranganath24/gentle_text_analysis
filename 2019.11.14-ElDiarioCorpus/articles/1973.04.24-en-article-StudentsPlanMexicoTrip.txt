Students plan Mexico tripCan anyone forget those pitiful posters which depicted some poor, unfortunate child in a barrio or ghetto and asked, "Will you help send this child to camp?" I don't know if anyone ever sent that poor child to camp and even if they did, 1 wonder how that "unfortunate" got along with the descendants of Daniel Boone complete with air mattress, radio and ice cooler to help them rough it. In this area there are some Chicano high school students who are not sitting back and waiting for someone to send them to camp they're out raising the money to a trip toMexico.The students are from Lafayette, Longmont, Erie and Boulder and are planning to spend a month touring the land of their ancestors. They will receive high school credit in history and will be accompanied by University students, teachers and chaperones. Dan Escalante and Sylvia Manzanares are two of the University students working to help the students raise the $4,500 they estimate the trip will cost. Escalante told £7 Diario they have raised about $1,500 to date. Some of the fund raisingevents have included a 1 7-mile walk from Longmont to Boulder, dances, a Chicano night at Tulagis and food sales. The students want to travel to Mexico for a number of reasons they say. Some are interested in seeing and learning more of their Indio ancestors. Others have voiced an interest in studying the art, music and general of Mexico. Anyone interested in knowing more about the students efforts can call Escalante at 442-8865, 7769135 and 665-5564 and Ms. Manzanares at 443-4694.
