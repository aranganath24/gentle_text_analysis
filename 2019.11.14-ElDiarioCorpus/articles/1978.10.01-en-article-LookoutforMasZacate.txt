Look out for Mas ZacateDiscos, with their flashy lights, vested dudes, and silky legged ladies are a professional threat to creativity. But that still won¡¯t cut off the live musicians only true lifeline the thrill of audio art. To avoid being stereotypical it is safe to say that minorities have distinct musical rhythms. And each piece a Latino group performs will have its ow n revised edition of that number. This is where Mas Zacate is distinguished. Chicanos have always been stereotyped as constantly singing and playing guitars. This is one trait that we can celebrate for its richness and validity. It is a responsibility we can hope not to lose for a $2OO record collection or a psychedelic fantasy of modern fashion and studded funk. Bands like Mas Zacate play their hearts out for people to have energy spent and spirits lifted. The constant hours of practice and perspiration that have transformed this band into cosmic enjoyment will destroy discomania and keep alive the basic human elenjents of live hearted entertainment that cannot be cheated by technology. The music of Mas Zacate is mainly disco and funk. Band leader Mike Martinez was formerly with the popular corrido band Los Pobres. His newest acquisitions to Mas Zacate are brothers Danny and Bernie. Lead guitarist Abel Aragon joined the troupe in June of this year. Like all musicians Mas Zacate aspires to cut a record, but unlike most musicians they probably will. We asked them if they have considered spicing up their act with gimmicks and strobe lights but they said that they arc entertainers not a freak show. ¡°We¡¯ll leave kid stuff to discomaniacs¡±. It just might be fate that discos crazed the generation when we needed a climax, but perhaps the thrill is gone. A warning to disco proprietors: LOOK OUT FOR MAS ZACATE!
