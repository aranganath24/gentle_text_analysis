Last May, 50 armed officers of the Albuquerque, New Mexico, Sheriffs Department invaded the small Chicano village of Chilili, and rounded up its residents at gun point. The action stemmed from the villagers blockade of a private road barring land developers from coming in. Chilili, New Mexico is located 35 miles southeast of Albuquerque and part of the original 41,000 acre Chilili land grant. With several vacation cabins and recreation areas dwindling the land grant size to a mere 5,000, 100 local residents have ba-ricaded the main road from further use to outsiders. Slabs of concrete and a cable stretched across the road have served as the blockade, however anyone wanting to exit is permitted. During the May 18 invasion by the sheriffs department 40 villagers were arrested. The court proceedings have been fruitless with District Judge Gerald Cole warning any future violence could lead to a liquidation of the remaining lands of the Chilili Land Grant.
