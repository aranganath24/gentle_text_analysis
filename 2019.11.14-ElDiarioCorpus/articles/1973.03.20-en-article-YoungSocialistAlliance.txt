Tomorrow afternoon at 4 in the UMC Forum Room, the Young Socialist Alliance and CEB are sponsoring a program on the African Liberation Struggles. The speaker will be Malik Miah and his talk will be followed by a showing of "A Luta Continua." A Luta Continua, “Through still photos and narration, the film captures the struggle of Frelimo’s struggle for national liberation against Portuguese colonialism," the Militant said. 'A Luta Continua does a fine job in portraying Frelimo's struggle to liberate Mozambique from Portuguese domination and it should be viewed by all who seek information on the situation there.”
