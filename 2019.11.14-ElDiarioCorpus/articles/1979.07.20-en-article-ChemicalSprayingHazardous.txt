Chemical spraying hazardous
In a recent article from the Washington Post written by Margot Hornblower, two housewives testified at a House Commerce subcommittee that people in their Scottsdale, Arizona community suffer from rectal bleeding, severe headaches, gastro-intestinal disorders, pneumonia, bronchial asthma and hives due to aerial drifts from pesticide spraying in the area. The content testimony of Suzanne Prosnear and Susan Watkins has created alarm among many. Community members arc disturbed by their involuntary exposure to chemical spraying. A spokesman from the Environmental Protection Agency says “citizens are asking for assurances of safety... and are seeking privacy from chemical intrusion in their fields.” Community members are not the only people exposed to pesticide spraying. Each year thousands of farmworkers inhale and
work in areas where chemical spraying takes places. Stricter regulations and enforcement of laws involving pesticides must be enacted in order to rid the potential danger of pesticides to people. Environmentalists say that failure to correct laws governing pesticides is due to House and Senate Agriculture committees having jurisdiction rather than public health responsibilities. Better and earlier public notice is important to inform community members about pesticide spraying and its dangers. Also buffer zones should be established between fields and houses. Many have been effected, health-wise because of chemical spraying, especially farmworkers. Effects are hazardous to the environment, animals and most drastically to people. Actions must be taken to prevent harmful, aerial drifts from pesticides.
