It is impossible with words to recreate the atmosphere of the “Garden” filled with progressive latin peoples. It was not the typical “rally” many in the movement have come to take for granted. The audience was a receptive one that hung on every word. The chants and cheers were occasionally mixed with boos and hisses, usually after an unpopular person like Rockefeller or Kissinger was mentioned. Some speakers who attempted to place his own organization above the call for solidarity were also booed. The overall impression left by the day of solidarity was one of renewed admiration for a well organized and dedicated people. It’s a long way to Madison Square Garden, but the solidarity developed between Chicanos and Puertoriquenos still can be felt today. One thing is certain, we are one Raza, we are one struggle sin fronleras. Venceremos!
