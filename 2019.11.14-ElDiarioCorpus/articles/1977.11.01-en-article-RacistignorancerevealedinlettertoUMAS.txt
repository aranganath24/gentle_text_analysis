Racist ignorance revealed in letter to UMASEditor's Note: This letter was mailed to the United Mexican American Student Organization, at the University of Colorado, Boulder. The content of the letter was analyzed by the Board of Directors of UMAS, which then ted to a committee being formed, and the rebuttal written up. UMAS fell that the only appropriate measure that could be taken was that the authors of the letter be exposed in the public¡¯s eye. DEAR WET-BACKS. SO, YOU DON¡¯T LIKE EC-4, NON CREDIT ELEMENTARY SCHOOL COURSES, COORS, GRAPES AND LETTUCE. (BUT YOU LOVE FOOD STAMPS WELFARE AND SEPT. 16) WHY DON¡¯T YOU GO BACK TOMEXICO AND BE RETARDS DOWN THERE? I REALIZE THAT, THE AVERAGE IQ OF A TACO BENDER IS ONLY 1, BUT WHY DONT YOU USE IT? WITH A LITTLE HELP, EC-4 WILL DO AWAY WITH YOUR SWITCHBLADE, HEY MAN QUE PASA, CLUB. THE NEXT STEP WILL BE THE DISCREDIT OF YOUR STUPID-ASS CHICANO COURSES. TRY ANOTHER DISTURBANCE, AS YOU DID AT THE UCSU MEETING AND WE WILL STOMP YOUR ASS, LIKE ITS NEVER BEEN. WE HAVE A PRESENT FOR YOU. HAPPY DREAMS, ASSHOLES, W . A . R . D .SOkRY THIS IS NOT WRITTEN IN SPIC; YOU¡¯LL HAVE TO GET SOMEONE TO DECODE THIS INTO IT FOR YOU Editor's Note: The above letter is evidence which reflects the mentality of the organization W.A.R.D., whose intention is to induce attitudes based on emotion instead of reason, thus provoking hostility on the account of Chicanos. Apparently the use of stereotypes expresses the views of W.A.R.D., demonstrating the ignorance some people afflict on others. W.A.R.D. attacks the Chicano struggle here on campus but also goes further to attack the mass struggle of Chicano people to gain democratic rights in thiscountry. Rhetoric and innuendo which is used by W.A.R.D. can¡¯t induce negative feeling towards W.A.R.D. by Chicano students, but can be used toexpose W.A.R.D. as a spontaneous reactionary organization which is trying to create reasons for Chicano students to react violently.
