Hundreds demonstrate against bicentennial in Santa Fe, N.M.On Sunday July 4th, 1976 the United States celebrated its 200th anniversary with jubilant crowds cheering on parades and other festivities sponsored by the bi-centennial organizations. But in Santa Fe, New Mexico Chicanos from all over the southwest came together to protest the theft of Aztlan. More than 500 people marched from Alto Park to the Santa Fe capitol building under the intense heat of the sun. The enthusiasm of the march, as the crowd yelled out “Que Viva La Raza” and singing songs of revolution, brought forth the long overdue sensation that marches and demonstrations had for the Chicano movement a few years ago. The arrival of the marchers onto the capitol grounds was greeted by clapping hands and a symbolic aura came over the crowd. Once again the Chicanos were on the move. Something which has been long overdue.La Federacion, which operates in Nueva Mexico, sponsored the demonstration in an effort to combine all the Chicano struggles. That being the struggles of the students, land issues, and third world people. La Federacion emphasized that we can not depend on the federal government to solve our problems. The Federacion has stated that the southwest is a Chicano nation and we must have control of it.” Teatros and other speakers continued the demonstration with skits exposing the bicentennial as well as United States imperialism in foreign countries. Topics concerning the land issue were addressed by the people from the surrounding area. The demonstration seemed to have accomplished the communication needed in combining the different factions of the Chicano movement. “Que Viva La Raza”.
