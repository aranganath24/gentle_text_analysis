On August 17, 1948 I became assistant pastor here 28 years ago. By constant visiting I feel that I became well acquainted with people in the area. I was here before and after KFSC began to broadcast. I am sure all agree that KFSC has given fine service to its audience. People here are concerned that something might happen to change the format of KFSC. They hope that the type of program, the method, and the format, will not be changed. My personal opinion and that of my colleague, Robert White, S. J., is that radio has a special value, and that Spanish speaking radio as used here tends to draw the neighborhood groups together. Sincerely, Rev. James McShane, S.J.
