Chicano students refile complaintsA Chicano at the C.U. Law School is refiling a complaint of discriminatory practices this month in response to the incompetence or inefficency of an HEW investigation. It concluded that a certain professor was incapable of discriminating. In the summer of 1977 four Chicano Law Students at the University of Colorado filed complaints, charging that one university professor discriminated against them on the basis of race and national origin. The complaint was filed with the Office of Civil Rights (HEW). The students charged thatthe professor in the Law School had used a loophole in the anonymous grading system to fail certain minority alumni. In the fall of 1977 one Chicano filed a complaint against the same instructor for ¡°flunking¡± all four minority women in the class. She again failed the course in the spring, charging that it was a retaliation for her actions in filing the complaint. During the period of inquiry, HEW appeared two or three times to acquire testimony and investigate the charges. At that time three other students filed complaints against the same professor. HEW was unable to establish a finding of discrimination based on the "uncontraverted finding" that the grading system is anonymous. Another Chicano said that there is a pattern of discrimination against minority women in a compilation of data (chronologically) that would support her allegations. HEW overlooked that pattern and did not compare female-male grades in past years. The anonymous grading system is faulty because each student has a number which is with his/her name on a master list. A professor with access to that "master list" could easily remember a three digit (1-1000) number and pass it on to his/her colleague.
