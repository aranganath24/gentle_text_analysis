The bilingual issue was of prime importance during the League of United Latin American Citizens (LULAC) state convention held in Denver last month. The entire convention agreed on the necessity to keep the Bilingual Act intact. Telegrams and special messages sent to Gov. Richard Lamm and state legislators reenforced the conventions concern. LULAC believes it is necessary to join together with the American G.I. Forum, IMAGE and other Hispanic organizations to step up Hispanic voter registration and other such activities. Numerous awards were given highlighted by the Council of the Year Award which went to the Southwest Denver Council. The award was accepted by Council president, Ernie Martinez. Women of the Year went to Mrs. Goergen of Pueblo for her work in the establishment of the Colorado LULAC Educational Fund (CLEF). Chuck Gomez was awarded Man of the Year merits for heading projects involving business promotion and this years convention. Rockwell International, Coors Industries and Martin Marietta received Special Appreciation Awards for their help in many projects and activities throughout the past year.
