What a farmworker facesThe life of the average contemporary middle class American is one of riches, health, and abundance. Life is easy and carefree. The average American doesn’t have to worry about whether he will have the rent money or if his children will have enough food to eat. Now consider the Farmworker. His life is not so easy and carefree. Everyday he’s faced with living with the poorest conditions, ill health and a low wage. The American has come a long way since the days of covered wagons and log cabins. Technology has given him machines that make his work load easier, machines that transport him from place to place and machines for recreational use. Technology has given the American one of the best-lived lives in the world. Unfortunately he does not realize that the food on his table is being harvested in this day and age by people who are no better off than his pioneer ancestors. The farmworker, as compared to the average middle class American, lives a much harder and uncomfortable life. The average yearly income for a family of four is $2,700.00. The farmworker must do stoop labor for 10-13 hours a day. He has no union representation; therefore, he is constantly exploited by the grower. This $2,700.00 a year figure includes the labor of children. Children must also work to insure the survival of the family. This means that the children are deprived of the education they are entitled to 80% of these children never reach high school. Wages such as these not only deprive the farmworker of an education, but deprive him of decent housing, good health, and much more. The average life expectancy for farmworkers is only 49 years of age.
