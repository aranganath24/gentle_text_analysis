Job information provided by MEIS
Editor's note: The following information was provided hv the Chicano Business Students Association . a Chicano organization on the Boulder campus. The Minority Employment Information Service is a non-profit student run organization on the Boulder Campus. The organization was started in the latter part of the ’73 spring semester. The organization became an actuality only out of need for such a service. Many minority students fail to find out about job opportunities while many employers search for the elusive "qualified” minority. While some C.U. organizations do seek jobs for their student members, little is done in the way of making that information available on a continuous basis to all minority students. MEIS wants to provide a central agency where all interested minority students can come to discover employment possibilities in the business sector. The emphasis of the service is one of a facilitating nature both for potential employers and employees. With many companies and organizations attempting to maintain or initiate “affirmative action” programs and with many more minority members taking interest in the business sector, our service can facilitate the efforts of both by acting as a liaison between business and minority students concerned about career, full-time and part-time employment opportunities. The service is an outgrowth of the Chicano Business Students Association and is also in contact with UMAS, MAP. BSA, and the Asian and Indian programs. All minority students interested in employment opportunities are encouraged to stop by room 149 at the School of Business, or call ext. 6181. The agency needs more help in running its activities.
