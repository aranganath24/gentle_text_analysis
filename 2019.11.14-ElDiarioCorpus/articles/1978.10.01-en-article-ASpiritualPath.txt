A Spiritual Pathby Fransisco GarciaThe Sundance, the annual Sioux sacred ceremony held earlier this month in Rosebud, South Dakota, emerged with a stronger spiritual bonding of the Indian nations as well as of Chicano people. The Meztizo, has been the victim of a cultural deprivation; the taking away of one side of a culture or religion by the exploitation suffered through the past and present centuries is now beginning to from a new reality. The Sun Dance Way is a prayer and away in which we could search for more balance, for more wholeness in ourselves. ¡°The Sundance is the Granddaddy Ceremony of the Sioux Nation,¡± expressed Chief Eagle Feather, who has conducted Sundances for more than 30 years and who brought back the Sundance and piercing which had. been prohibited by the Wasicu, (gringo) for several years. Frank Black Elk, Director of the American Indian Movement in Denver, explains that ¡°piercing in the Sun Dance is the Ultimate Sacrifice a Warrior could do for his people. Your own self, the only thing you can > give in the universe so your people I won¡¯t have to suffer so much, could be i part of the balance.¡± One is to be totally sincere with j oneself when giving flesh offerings. | The Sun Dance is also a prayer in I which man, woman, or child goes I through, for different reasons, such as | for more unity amongst the tribes or I people. The Wasicu saw it as barbaric I and savage like looking at it from a I foreign perspective and distorting its ¡ö reasons. I Chief Leonard Crow Dog said ¡°the I Sun Dance is a Red Man's dance for I Red Man only.¡± This included Chii canos, we are represented as one of the | 12 tribes that participated in this year¡¯s I and past year¡¯s Sun Dances at Rose I I Bud, South Dakota. ¡°Since this is the I red man¡¯s dance, Chief Crow Dog says I that Chicanos are to be respected as Indian people and it is time for the Red man and the Brown man to become ¡®One Mind!!¡±
