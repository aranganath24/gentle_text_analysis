President Carters campaign promise to place minorities and women into high level administrative positions has not developed, and there is no indication that more minorities will be placed. Of 265 top level positions, 76 percent are filled by whites and figures released by the White House personnel office show that only 4 per-cent of top jobs are filled by Latinos, 9 percent by Blacks, 4 percent by women, one Asian and no American Indians have been named to any of Carters positions. There are only two women in Carters Cabinet: Commerce Secretary Juanita Kreps and Patricia Roberts Harris, secretary of Housing and Urban Development. Mrs. Harris is the only Black to be appointed to Carters Cabinet. Other high level positions filled by Blacks in the administration are U.N. rtinbassador Andrew Young, Army secretary Clifford Alexander, Solicitor General Wade McGree and Eleanor Homes Norton, chairman of the Equal Employment Opportunities Commission. The Congressional Black Caucus recently began a review of Carters appointments and how they affect Blacks. Also in the review will be the progress of hiring of Blacks. Rep. Parren Mitchell, D-Md, caucus chairman said There have been some breakthroughs, but were noi seeing the kind of breakthrough that Carter promised.
