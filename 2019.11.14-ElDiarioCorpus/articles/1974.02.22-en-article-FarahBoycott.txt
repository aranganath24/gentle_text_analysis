Farah boycottFarah boycott Since May, 1972, 4000 Chicano workers have been on strike in Texas and New Mexico against Farah Manufacturing Company. In late 1969, Farah workers started organizing to bring in the Amalgamated Clothing workers. The grievances are mostly based on the fact that Farah is "a family owned enterprise." Other grievances include job security, low pay, "non-existent pension plan", low paying hospitilization, and constant increase of work production level. The main demand of the strike is union recognition.The boycott has been very successful because, since the beginning of the strike, Farah has lost over $2O million. The combined effect of the nation-wide boycott and inexperienced "scabs" in the plants has resulted in the closing of the New Mexico, the San Antonio plants, and the plant in Victoria, Texas. The Farah strike is an important step forward in the struggle of the Chicano people. A victory at Farah will be a turning point in the struggle to organize the non-union industries where Chicanos work at the lowest paid jobs.
