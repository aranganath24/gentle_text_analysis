This, the first issue of El Diariu Magazine is dedicated to the memory of Ricardo Falcon and all of the other soldados of the Chicano 'i movement who have died or were imprisoned fighting for la causa. Their struggles will not be forgotten, nor will they cease, for we have learned from their examples and we will shout their messages until we are all freed, or silenced.
