Help a brother!In the world of La Raza the strength that has always held us together in times of stress is the extended family, la familia. When one of us hurts, we all hurt, and we all work to overcome the problem. Sam Avalos has a tremendous problem since he was injured in an automobile accident: his medical expenses are far above his family's income. Sam is now paralyzed from the waist down and is undergoing intensive treatment at the Craig Rehabilitation Center in Denver. Each of us and all of us as a group can aid Sam in his time of need. El Diario has established a fund for Sam where contributions can be sent. The fund is the Coronado National Bank, 1400 Irving, Denver, Colorado 80204. Contributions can also be brought to the El Diario office, UMC 416, or the UMAS office, UMC 187.
