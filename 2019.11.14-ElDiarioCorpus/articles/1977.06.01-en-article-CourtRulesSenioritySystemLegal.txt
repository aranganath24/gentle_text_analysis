The Supreme Court has ruled that the worker seniority system is legal even though it perpetuates racial discrimination. The justices believed that the 1964 Civil Rights Act barring discrimination in employment was not meant to outlaw existing seniority lists. The court admitted that there was discrimination against blacks and Chicanos in the trucking industry. Justice Potter Stewart said, An otherwise neutral, legitimate seniority system does not become unlawful (under the Civil Rights Act) simply because it may perpetuate pre-act discrimination. Stewart said workers who can prove they were discriminated against in jobs since 1964 may be eligible for seniority retroactive to the time they were refused jobs. Stewart also said they need not have applied for jobs if they can show discriminatory company practices discouraged them from doing so. Justice Thurgood Marshall opposed the ruling saying, Equal opportunity will remain a distant dream for many minority workers.
