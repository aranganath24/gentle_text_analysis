Education and the Barrio

The Colorado Board of Education is currently involved in a case charging that with the current method of financing monies for schools, poorer districts receive less quality education than wealthier areas. A great portion of a school districts budget comes from property taxes. Since the wealthier neighborhoods are able to derive more monies from property taxes than in poor neighborhoods, those schools then receive more funding. Funding schools by this method has always created much concern and controversy about the quality of education in the low socio-economic districts. Small budgets disable poor school districts to have quality materials, proper rooms and facilities and teacher wages are very low. In essence, it is felt that the poor are being punished for being poor
