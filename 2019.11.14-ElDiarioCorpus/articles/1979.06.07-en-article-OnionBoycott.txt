ONION BOYCOTT

Farmworkers in the Rio Grande Valley have joined the Texas Farmworkers Union in a strike against the Charles Wetegrove Company. The Rio Grande Valley farmworkers in Raymondville, where they harvest onion, united with Texas Farm Workers Union in early April. The demands of the farmworkers include better wages. As of now workers receive only 50 cents per sack of onion from the largest producer of onion in southern Texas. Each sack weighs 60 pounds. With this low salary it is difficult for workers to support their families. One farmworker with a family of 4 stated that their total earnings is only $lO to $l5 per day. With that type of salary it is almost impossible to survive. The strikers are now asking to get paid 80 cents per sack. They want a signed contract with the Wetegrove Company that ensures and meets their demands on wages. Also farmworkers want a person from the Texas Farm Workers Union to represent them to the Charles Wetegrove Company. Farmworkers are also demanding better working conditions and improved health and security benefits. For more information or interest in supportive efforts contact: Texas Farm Workers Union, P.O.
