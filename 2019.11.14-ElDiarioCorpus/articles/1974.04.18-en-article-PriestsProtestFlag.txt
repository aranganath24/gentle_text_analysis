Priests protest FlagAs a symbol the American flag stands pale before the true Christian symbol-the cross-because it mixes good and bad images together. This is while some people view the flag as a sign of peace and good will, others may view it as a sign of discrimination, inequality, or vengeance. Such a ‘tainted symbol’ has no place beside the pure and unconditional love and forgiveness of the cross.” Protesting the presence of the American flag in the sanctuary of the Church, three Roman Catholic priests with the help of five other persons allegedly removed seven US flags from the sanctuaries of seven catholic churches in Colorado Springs, last March 23. They also distributed 1,200 leaflets in six churches before masses and according to the Denver Post "admitted taking the flags in a message to the parisoners.” Two of the priests Rev. William Sulzman and Rev. Stephen Handen declined to tell the Post where the flags are stored or whether they intend on returning them. The third priest who allegedly took the flags is Rev. Richard Buhr. According to the Post, leaflets were distributed at Corpus Cristi. Divine Redeemer. Holy family. Sacred Heart. St. Mary’s and St. Paul's Churches, all in Colorado Springs.
