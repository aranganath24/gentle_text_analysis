Summer program still in danger
In last month’s article “Financial Aid Attacks EOP” minority students concerned about their programs submitted a list of demands related to financial aid, work study, and the Summer Institute. Friday, HOP officials announced that funding for the Summer Institute Program (SIP) was made available by the University of Colorado Administration. Although the SIP was funded, it does not necessarily mean that the program will function under a normal basis. The question of summer work study, which provides EOP with the majority of their staff for the Summer Institute, was left unanswered by the administration. Minority students on the C.U. campus are becoming more and more concerned about the wellbeing of the EOPs. “It seems like every year it’s either the state or administration trying to take one thing or another away from us”, one student said. According to the students involved with the issue, it appears to be a general consensus that the administration is using the well know tactic of telling the students their going to lose everything in order to make the designated cuts seem insignificant. The students who are aware of the issues at hand are combining efforts to build support for all the minority programs on the C.U. campus. “The minority programs are for minority students, and it is them who will have to defend it”, said one Chicano student
