Of all the obstacles facing Chicanos in their effort to gain access to school boards, city council, and county government, the at-large election is perhaps the most devastating. An at-large election system is one where there are no regional or district representatives. Under an at-large system there is no requirement that a candidate reside in a particular part of a given school district, city or county. Thus, all the candidates elected to school board which serves minority students may all reside in the anglo neighborhoods. The result of such a system is the election of school boards, city councils, and county boards which have no Chicano input into policies and government. An at-large election system discriminates against Chicanon in the following manners. Say, for example, there is a school district consisting of about forty percent Chicanos who are eligible to vote. In an election Where there are three vacancies, the Anglo can place their three candidates on the ballot while the Chicano community can place their three candidates (usually from the barrios) on the ballot. Since most Anglos tend to vote for Anglo candidates and Chicanos vote for Chicano candidates, all of the Anglo candidates will receive sixty percent of the vote, while the Chicanos receive forty percent. Under these circumstances Chicanos will never be able to elect their candidates.
