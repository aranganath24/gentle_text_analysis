Thieme no, Chicanos si!We join with the UMAS Board of Directors in urging the University Faculty Senate to vote no-confidence in CU President Frederick P. Thieme. In the capacity of University President, Thieme has constantly sought to discredit Chicanos and other minorities at this campus. He has been a constant obstacle to minority efforts to improve relationships between the disadvantaged students and the University. He has publicly referred to UMAS as a Òjunior Mafia," which is threatening his administration. He uses this sort of propaganda in an attempt to undermine the wide base of support minority programs have received in this state. His continued presence can only work to hamper our efforts for justice through parity. For more than 100 years, the Thieme's of the University kept the doors closed to Chicanos, Blacks, Indians, Asians and the poor. Those doors have since been kicked in, it is time to kick Thieme out!
