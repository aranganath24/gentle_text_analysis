Tad Sylvester, who is seeking a seat on the Boulder City Council, has told El Diario of several 
key aspects of his campaign. I plan to seek implementation of rent stabilization to combat the 
high cost of renting an apartment in Boulder. Too many students elderly people, and low-income 
Boulderites cannot afford the high rents of the Boulder community, Sylvester said. Sylvester 
also plans to work for better wages for the working-class people in Boulder. He feels anyone 
employed in the city of Boulder government should make no less than $7OO a month. “You 
cannot stop growth in Boulder, but you can control it,” Sylvester said. Tad Sylvester is the only 
one of the numerous City Council candidates who felt that El Diario readers should hear his 
views on the issues in the upcoming election.
