Texas farm workers left Austin, Texas June 18th beginning their 1,482 mile march for Human Rights, which culminates in Washington D.C. Labor day (Sept. 5). The farm workers hope to gain support by the American people and the president toward articles of legislation. The Texas Farm Workers Union (TFW) seek to obtain collective bargaining rights for all agricultural workers in this country and to repeal Section 148 of the Taft-Hartley Act. In every state excluding California, farm workers are prevented from holding union elections. Other laborers were included in the National Labor Relations Act (NLRA) of 1935, but farmworkers were left out. Section 148 is known as the right to work law. This law gives individual states the right to have laws prohibiting union membership. This deceiving law supposedly gives workers the right not to join a union. There are 20 right to work states, 11 which are in the south. The march will pass through eight of these. The farm workers were met with violence by growers and the Texas Rangers in their efforts to organize in the fields. No legal justice or rights such as the TaftHartley Act have been other dilemmas. Many Northern industries have left that area causing unemployment, and moving to the South and Southwest exploiting workers in right to work states. Long hours, low wages and terrible conditions are not uncommon. The march hopes to expose these issues.
