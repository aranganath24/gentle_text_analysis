Tijerina in Denver
Reics Lopez Tijerina was in Denver for a few days early this month. The fiery New Mexico leader of Tierra-Amarilla-Court-House-Raid fame spoke to an audience of 350 at the Auraria Community Center. While in Denver, the onetime militant leader of the Alianza, professed a new pacifist philosophy. He is establishing a new institute to research justice. Because of his new approach he has been compared to Ghandi and Dr. Martin Luther King by the Rocky Mountain News. Although he preaches brotherhood, Tijerina has not been able to muster the support for his new organization that he enjoyed in the late sixties. A Congresso for Culture and Land Reform held last October in Albuquerque, which he hosted, ended in complete chaos. In his talk in Denver he gave a brief personal history of himself. Born in Fall City, Texas the son of a Protestant minister and himself a minister, Tijerina continues his fight with an emphasis on law. Tijerina went on to say that in 1955, he and a group of followers founded a community in Arizona called Valle de Paz. The group survived by picking cotton in the near by communities of Casa Grande, Eloy and Aztec. After about a year the community was burned to the ground by Anglos. He said after its burning, he traveled to Villa de Guadelupe, Mexico where he studied the treaty of Guadelupe Hidalgo (a much contested document which ended the Mexican American War in I 848). When he returned to New Mexico, he found that the Hermanos de Conferencia (Penitentes believed to be of the Third Order of St. Francis) had conserved a majority of the 400-year history of the Chicano in the Southwest. He quoted a law they had been in compliance with: "Segun La Ley dos, Titulo uno, Libro seis, de las Leys de la Indias.‚Äù He stressed the point that nowhere in the United States are these laws of the Indies being studied. Yet there are 6,500 laws, nine books, and three volumes that have a direct bearing on Chicano history.
