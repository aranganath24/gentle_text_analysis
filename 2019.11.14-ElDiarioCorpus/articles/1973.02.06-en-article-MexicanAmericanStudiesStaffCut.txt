Mexican-American studies staff cut by 50 percent
A work study budget cut in the Mexican-American Studies Department has reduced their staff by approximately fifty percent. Jesus Granado, coordinator for the Mexican - American Studies Department, said his previous commitment from UMAS-EOP for 30 work study slots has now been reduced to 16 work study students because of recent action taken by UMAS-EOP. “If they keep cutting our staff like this, our Mexican American Studies department will vanish,” Granado said. According to Granado, UMAS—EOP justified the cut by citing lack of funds. However, Granado said the monies from the budget cut were channeled back into the UMAS—EOP budget possibly to help fund a new Advising component. The staff reduction will inevitably pose problems for the department. Granado believes the heaviest loss to be felt in the research and Independent Study areas. Because of shortage of work study students and teaching assistants who previously handled the jobs, registration in the Independent Study classes has been restricted to smaller groups. There will be only six T.A.'s working in the department this semester, in comparison to 12 last semester. "This department is the only department with undergraduate T.A.'s.” Granado said. UMAS-EOP spokesmen were unavailable for comment.
