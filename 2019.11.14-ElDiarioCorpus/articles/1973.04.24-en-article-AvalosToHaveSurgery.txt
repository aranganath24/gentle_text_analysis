Avalos to have surgerySam Avalos is preparing for an operation which will have a great bearing on his hopes of ever walking again. Sam was injured in an automobile accident nearly a month ago near Gallup, New Mexico, and since then has been recovering at the Craig Rehabilitation Center in Denver. He cannot walk now, nor does he have the full use of his right hand. After an extensive series of X-ray examinations of Sam’s spinal cord and backbone, doctors at Craig concluded that an operation would be needed torelieve the pressure of nerves controlling Sam’s right arm. With the full use of his right arm and hand, Sam could then work on regaining the use of his legs by exercising on parallel bars. However, the operation is a complex one and the outcome is still in doubt. The operation and surgery will take place tomorrow. A number of students are working on fund-raising projects to help Sam with the tremendous expenses he is incurring. In addition, the Sam Avalos fund at the Coronado National Bank, 1400 Irving in Denver, is receiving varying contributions. One fund-raising event is being planned now. Student volunteers are needed to help carry out the benefit, which is being planned by El Diario staff. If you can help in this project, contact Paul Mora at 443-2211, ext. 8316, or come to the UMC, room 416. We can all do a little to help Sam in his time of need.
