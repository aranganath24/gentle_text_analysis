Police and nearby residents attempt to rid Chicanos of Sloans Lake

Harassment has been the cause of recent friction between police and the Denver community. What originally was a problem with the congestion of automobiles at Sloans Lake Park has escalated to the point of police harassment of young and old Chicanos. For several years the park has been the public recreation spot for many of the Denver Community. With a general absence of such recreation sites in metropolitan Denver there is bound to be congestion, especially on weekends. Residents of the area last year formed the Sloans Lake Citizens Group to help alleviate the problems of congestion and “rowdiness” around the park. Pressure on City Councilman Larry Perry resulted in the appointment of Patrolman James “Buster” Snider to patrol the area. Snider who killed Luis Jr. Martinez in 1973, is Denver’s most prolific ticket-writer and has been recognized as a racist cop who directs his harasment to the Chicano community. Snider has been responsible for countless unsubstantiated tickets on grounds of traffic congestion and “rowdiness”. On April 29, Snider stopped Ms. Judy Hinojosa-Iske (a service worker for Servicios de la Raza) and used profane language in her presence. Most recently Snider has been removed from the area for reasons of alleviating the problem of police harassment.
