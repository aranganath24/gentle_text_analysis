Castaneda keeps winning

Steve (Ted) Castaneda, a University of Colorado junior and UMAS student, has been 
representing the U.S. in Europe this summer, as one of the best distance runners in the 
world. Castaneda, a runner for the U.S. Track and Field Team, has competed in four 
meets already this summer while on the European tour. He has competed in meets 
representing the U.S. against West Germany, Italy, Russia, and Africa. Castaneda 
qualified for the European tour by finishing second in the six-mile run at the AAU 
national championships in Bakersfield, California in mid-June. His time of 27:22.4 ranks 
him fifth on the all-time U.S. six-mile list, trailing the American holder, Steve Prefontaine, 
at 27:09. According to Assistant Track Coach Jerry Quiller, “Castaneda is the best 
distance runner in Colorado; he tied the C.U. record for the fastest ever run by 
somebody from Colorado. Castaneda has added much to the C.U. athletic
program, including his second place three-mile finish at the NCAA championships at 
13:10.6. Castaneda, a native of Colorado Springs and former student of Palmer High 
School has set other records at winning the Class AAA two-mile as a senior in 1970. 
Steve intends to give plenty back to the UMAS program when he graduates; he prefers 
to work with teenage kids at the institutional level. “I want to help kids, especially 
Mexican-American kids," he says. He’s interested in the drop-out rate for Chicanos and 
wants to do something about it; to help get kids back in school. Coach Quiller says, 
“Ted’s been great for the UMAS program, just as he's been great for our program.” 
"He's really more interested in that program than athletics," Quiller said. Castaneda runs 
twice a day except Sunday, running a total of 15 miles per day.
