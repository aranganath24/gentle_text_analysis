They WILL RETURN to court May 20 for a hearing to hear ARGUMENTS WHETHER THEY SHOULD BE BOUND OVER FOR COURT. AT THEIR FIRST HEARING LAST WEEK, PRELIMINARY ARGUMENTS WERE HEARD FROM THEIR ATTORNEY, KEN PADILL A OF DENVER. AT THAT HEARING, THE TWO DEFENDANTS AND THEIR NUMEROUS SUPPORTERS WERE PHOTOGRAPHED BY A MOB OF POLICE PHOTOGRAPHERS. They will probably be tried after THE SEMESTER ENDS AND WILL NEED THE CONTINUED SUPPORT OF UNIVERSITY STUDENTS. Photo by Ramon Vera, Ahora
