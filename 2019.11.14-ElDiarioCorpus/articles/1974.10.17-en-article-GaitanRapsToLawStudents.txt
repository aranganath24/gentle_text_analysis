Gaitan raps to law students
Jose Gaitan, one of the leaders of the prison reform movement in Colorado and an inmate at the Colorado State penitentiary in Canon City, spoke to a recent gathering of the Chicano Law Students at the university. Gaitan noted the large percentage of minority-group convicts (34 percent Chicano and 21 percent Black, when Chicanos make up only 12 percent of the state's population and Blacks only 6 percent). He criticized state-government-initiated prison reform methods, saying. "Rehabilitation is just a big joke, they don't know what the hell to do about us.” Gaitan participates in the Crime Prevention Team Program in which convicts speak to different groups and organizations about life inside a prison. The message the Chicano convicts try to get across is pretty simple: "There's not really much you can do for your people when you re locked up inside a prison. Keep your nose clean and you can light the man on a more equal basis.” Gaitan will be eligible for parole in January, but the parole board has already denied him freedom for reasons that were never explained. Governor John Vanderhoof would only say, "I feel the Board s action was justified." Vanderhoof s administration came under heavy attack alter Gaitan and others revealed widespread corruption in the prison staff. Former Acting Warden Fred Wyse was later indicted by a grand jury for requisitioning prison supplies and foodstuffs for personal use, but Gaitan paid a heavy price for his act of courage.
