El Paso gasALBUQUERQUE, N.M. El Paso Natural Gas Co. and Northwest Pipeline Corp. were named in a $26 million damage suit filed Monday in federal court. The suit, brought by the Jicarilla Apache Tribe, alleged that since 1972, the company had caused the tribe to lose royalties and bonuses on gas extracted from reservation lands in the San Juan Basin in northwestern New Mexico.“El Paso, by reason of its monopoly as the only purchaser of gas for interstate transmissions ar.d sale in the San Juan Basin, was able to force other producers on the tribe's lands, selling gas to El Paso, to agree to...discontinue accounting for liquid hydrocarbons," the petition alleges. The suit accused El Paso of depriving the tribe of royalties based on the value of hydrocarbon products produced under a contract "entered into without the tribe’s consent." It also alleges that El Paso fixed and maintained wellhead gas prices until late 1972.
