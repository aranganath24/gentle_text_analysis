Denver Youth Shot

On February 12, 1979, Felix “Sonny” Jaramillo, a 17-year-old Denver Chicano, was critically wounded by Sheriff’s Deputy Russell McGilvery. Jaramillo and Roger Abeyta jumped from the van in which they were being transported to juvenile hall as the vehicle came to a stop. The two youths were handcuffed together. McGilvery said he fired two warning shots in an attempt to halt the fleeing youths. Apparently these shots were intended to actually stop Jaramillo and Abeyta rather than serve as a warning since Jaramillo suffered two wounds from the same bullet, one in the chest and one in the back. A Denver General Hospital spokesperson said that is was impossible to determine where the bullet entered. The Jaramillo family has received support and encouragement from area Chicanos who have discovered that the

Sheriff Department’s rules state that officers never fire on a non-violent offender and they specify that officers never fire warning shots. These rules are applicable in the case of the Jaramillo shooting since mother of the victim, Betty Jaramillo, said her son Felix was wanted since October 1978 for walking away from a youth farm, where he had been sent for truancy and theft and had not been considered a violent offender at any time. Boulder Chicanos have considered the circumstances of the shooting and will take whatever steps are necessary to support Jaramillo and all Chicanos against these acts of police brutality. Also, after the shooting, Jaramillo needed blood transfusions which required an organized effort by some Boulder Chicanos to donate blood.
