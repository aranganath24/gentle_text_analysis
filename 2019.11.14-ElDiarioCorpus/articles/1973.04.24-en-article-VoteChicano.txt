Vote Chicano!There are two Chicano candidates in the Boulder Valley School District Board elections set for next Tuesday, May 1. The two candidates are Peter Garcia, an out-reach worker with the Boulder County Mental Health Dept, and Richard Garcia, Director of the University’s Migrant Action Program. The candidates both feel it will take a large Chicano turnout at the polls for them to win. There are approximately 500 Chicanos registered to vote in this election; 500 votes is a pretty good headstart in an election which may take as little as 2000 votes to win. Richard Garcia is running in District B and Peter Garcia is running in District F, but you don’t have to live in their respective districts to vote for them. This is an at-large election. There has always been a tendency on the part of University students to avoid involvement in local politics, but recent elections in Boulder have demonstrated the potency of the student vote. While we are students in Boulder, we are part of this community. If we are in a position to make changes which will benefit the total community, we must do so. The public school system has been damaging to Chicanos. If this is ever to change we must have representation. Vote for the Garcias on May 1.
