Chicanos invade ASUCby Sonny MontoyaUntil October of 1972 the only Chicano input into the student government was infrequent appearances by members of the varying UMAS organization committee persons to ask the government for funds. Time and time again the UMAS students and the members of the Associated Students of the University of Colorado (ASUC) Senate clashed over the amount of funding for Chicano groups, with Chicano groups receiving far less than they had requested. Then, just prior to the ASUC senate elections in October of 1972, a group of Chicano students decided they would have input into the senate by electing senators to ASUC. There followed an intensive campaign for the election of the five Chicano senatorial candidates. After a tremendous showing in the primary election, the five Chicano senatorial candidates were elected to the senate. The senators next formed a coalition with the New Directions Coalition, a like-thinking group of senators, and began to correct some of the inequities on the senate. However, the Chicano senators and the NDC senators did not have a working majority on the Senate, and there followed constant hassles between the NDC-Chicano coalition and the few conservatives on the senate. A chance to rectify this situation came very soon. When the next senate elections were held in March of Õ73, the senators worked and fought for elction of a new tri-executive for the student government. Two previous NDC senators, Patty Price and Paul Boetcher, along with Chicano student Jess Vigil, were set against a conservative slate advocating abolishment of the ASUC form of government. The NDC-UMAS coalition defeated the conservative slate decisively. Accomplsihments by the senate and the Chicano executive include influences in minority appointments to the various joint boards. An example of this is the appointment of Eileen Torres to the Cultural Events Board.
