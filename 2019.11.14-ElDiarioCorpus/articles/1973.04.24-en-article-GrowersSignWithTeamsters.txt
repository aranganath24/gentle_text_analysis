Growers sign with TeamstersWith the expiration of United Farm Workers Union contracts with California grape growers, a struggle has begun over who will represent the farmworkers. As soon as the UFWU contracts expired last week, 85 percent of the growers signed contracts with the Teamster Union officials, even though the Teamsters have been charged with having no real right to represent the farmworkers. “The growers signed with the Teamsters because the Teamsters don’t demand any rights for the workers,” Carol Longoria of the Denver UFWU office said. She said the Teamsters “didn’t even ask the farmworkers if they wanted the Teamsters union representation.” Immediately after the growers signed with the Teamsters, 1600 of the Cochella Valley’s grape pickers went out on strike, Longoria said. “The Teamsters and the growers agree to ‘sweetheart’ Contracts," Longoria said, “where little or no worker benefits are sought or obtained." Although the basic wage sought by the Teamsters and the UFWU for the farmworkers is about the same, the two unions differ greatly on what benefits the workers should have, (seerelated story.) Maureen Monahan of the Denver UFWU said that no grape boycott will go into effect until May, when the real grape harvesting begins. Two grape growers did renegotiate with the UFWU, she said, but “the other 150-200 growers will have to be convinced." Since the striking farmworkers won’t be earning any wages during the strike, the UFWU is asking that contributions be sent to aid the striking workers. Contributions can be sent to the United Farm Workers, Keene, California, 93531.
