Allende’s widow to speak at March 17 ritesHortencia Allende, widow of the slain former president of Chile, Salvador Allende, and representatives of other national and international liberation struggles will speak in Denver at the first anniversary of the March 17 attack on the Crusade for Justice. They will join with local leaders in a day of commemoration exactly a year to the day of the police attack on the Crusade and Escuela Tlatclolco which left Luis “Junior” Martinez dead and dozens injured and scores arrested. The day of protest will take place on the capitol steps. Other speakers will include: Rudolfo “Corky” Gonzales, (Head of the Crusade), Los Tres del Barrio (charged with shooting a narcotics agent who happened to be a drug pusher), Angela Davis (co-chairperson of the National Alliance against Racist and Political Repression) Juan Mardi Bras (leader of the Puerto Rican Socialist Party for the independence of Puerto Rico), Bert Corona (founder of Centro de Accion Social Autonoma in Los Angeles), and Mario Cantu (director of CASA in San Antonio). The demonstration will be the first appearance of Mrs. Allende in this area. She has addressed several labor unions in the U.S. Salvador Allende was killed by the military junta which took over the democratically elected government in Chile. Since March 17, no policemen have stood trial for the attack, although only four of the nearly 60 persons arrested were prosecuted and only one of them Mario Vasquez was convicted of any wrong doing. According to Chicanos at Vasquez’ trial, the testimony of the police officers was often contradicted, yet the jury convicted him.Angela Davis is silhouetted against the first five letters of Colorado printed on wall mats at the Field house where she spoke Feb. 6. She called for the unification of all oppressed peoples and peoples of color
