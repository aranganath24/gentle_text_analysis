English course revitalized for Summer 74A vast majority of the UMASEOP Summer Program students are not considered sophisticated and skillful writers. Part of this problem may lie in the fact that those students have only been exposed to the conventional and traditional methods of writing instruction found in most secondary schools today. The problem may also be a result of instructors imposing their pedagogical philosophies on Chicano students who find little or no relevancy to their particular needs. Because Chicanos come to the Summer Program so poorly equipped with the basic writing skills and because their writing often tends to be an accumulation of trite ideas assembled in an unorganized, rambling manner, it is our goal to hopefully motivate the students into writing about their experiences and their philosophies while incorporating the necessary writing skills. To ensure this proficiency in writing, an individualized or at least a semi-individualized approach should be employed. The length of class periods have been extended this summer to an hour and a half. Because of this, a lecture-seminar approach can be utilized. The lecture portion would entail the introduction of new material either in a large group or in several small groups while the remainder of the class time would be conducted as a seminar.Furthermore, all T.A.Õs hired should be English majors and should demonstrate a strong command of those skills stressed in the courses. We will, however, cut back the number of T.A.'s per class from two to one for budgetary purposes. In addition, the writing lab will be utilized throughout the Summer Program. This will allow those students who are still having severe difficulties to receive the additional attention needed. (Please see attached proposal on Writing lab.) It is our belief that if all of the above changes are initiated and utilized, our students will be able to function adequately in a university atmosphere
