Chicanos fight School Board racistsThe Boulder Valley Board of Education has forcefully exposed the racism that many would deny even exists in Boulder by denying Chicanitos a bilingual education program. By a 5-2 vote Board members Ed Hubin, Sybil Downing, Betty Luckow, Dominic Ferrera, and Fred Bierhaus showed Boulder Valley Chicanos just how much racism does exist locally. Almost every Chicano who spoke in favor of the Bilingual program was attacked by the Board members who from the beginning were against the proposal. Thus far the only voice to speak for the Board’s actions has been the Boulder Daily Camera, easily Colorado's most antiChicano newspaper. From every other quarter has come cries of outrage at the Board's actions. The two Board members who voted for the proposal, Peter Garcia and Virginia Patterson, denounced their fellow board members for their action. Yet we may be able to take our complaints one step further. Community Chicanos are now organizing for possible legal action against the school board. The suit will be based on a recent Supreme Court decision commanding local school districts to accommodate non-English speaking students. If you have children who will be exposed to the type of injustice and educational sham, now is your time to fight one small battle for oyr children. Meetings are being held now by community Chicanos intent on stopping further racist actions by the Boulder Valley Board of Education. Get out ind support ’ these efforts, for the education of your children is at stake.
