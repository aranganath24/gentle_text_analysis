Student Groups Suffer Budget Cutbacks

BOULDER - On October 11 and 18 the Student Organization Committee (SOC), held budget hearings. SOC is a committee that was formed through the passage of the EC-4 legislation by the University of Colorado Student Union (UCSU). The EC-4 bill eliminated mandatory student fee funding of student groups. The SOC is supposed to be a helping committee for student groups and a direct liaison to UCSU in order to prevent permanent extinction of these groups, however, the SOC procedure certainly lacked sympathy for student groups who suffered disastrous budget cutbacks. Some groups received no funding for the next fiscal year. Evidence of the attitude can clearly be seen in the initial memorandum from the SOC to student groups which stated “All Budgets will be heard on

two consecutive Wednesdays . . . anyone who is late will not be heard..." Yet the SOC made no mention or showed no remorse when some group representatives were forced to wait up to 2 hours to be heard at the meeting. Also, at the hearings the student groups were interrogated by members of the SOC and subjected to shouting matches. The only alternative which the SOC could offer was a merger of those student groups judged to be ‘‘duplicating efforts”, however, it was made very clear that all the groups held their own autonomy and could justify their viability. The SOC is aware that the only true alternative for continued existence of student groups would have to be a total abolishment of EC-4, yet it was concluded that for at least this fiscal year student groups would do well if they could stay alive because as of now EC-4 is a fact. It was pointed out to members of the SOC by the UMAS representative, Antonia Sandoval that they should “take a minute to ask themselves who they (SOC) are doing the dirty work for.” The SOC could only respond with a subtle nod of agreement.
