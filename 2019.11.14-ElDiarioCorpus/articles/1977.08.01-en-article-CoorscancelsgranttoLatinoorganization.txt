Coors cancels grant to Latino organizationThe Adolph Coors Jr. Foundation, has cancelled a $50,000 grant previously awarded to the American G.I. Forum of Colorado, a Mexican American organization that represents veterans of W.W.11 and the Korean war. The foundation cancelled the gram after the G.I. Forum supported striking Coors workers and cancelled its plans to drop a 9-year boycott of Coors beer. The strike was called because of contract disputes, and poor working conditions. The Forum has maintained a boycott of Coors beer because it believed the firm had practiced racial discrimination in its hiring procedures. Ivan Padilla of Denver, who headed the forum¡¯s national boycott of Coors, said the boycott was temporarily suspended earlier this year as their talks with the Coors Company and the foundation moved ahead. The Forum applied to the Coors foundation for a grant to continue operating an economic development project started earlier under a grant from another source. Gordon Jones, the manager, told Ivan Padilla, the Forums strike support ¡°was like biting the hand that feeds you.¡± Seeking a compromise, Padilla wrote the foundation, asking that the money be put in escrow until the strike is ended. Foundation board members Joe, Bill, Pete and Jeff Coors. as well as Robert Windsor, a relative held their quarterly meeting and decided this wouldn¡¯t be done. Instead, they cancelled the grant. Jones said the foundation seeks to be sure that any potential recipient of its funds is stable and nonpolitical. He said the G.I. Forum¡¯s decision to back the strike made it a political group and indicated its policies might not be as stable as the foundation would want them to be.
