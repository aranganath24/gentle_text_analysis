Changes in CounselingThe UMAS-EOP Counseling Component will be offering a new “counseling package” for Chicano students in need of advising. The new counseling procedure will be implemented during the spring semester. Individual Peer Counselors will no longer be assigned to a group of students. Instead, the entire pool of counselors will be divided and assigned to work in specific areas, namely, financial aid, academic advising, job placement and student housing, and, medical and dental information assistance. The new procedure is designed to aid counselors who have difficulty in contactingtheir prospective students. It will also benefit the student, allowing counselors more time to spend with them. Counseling Coordinator, Felipe Roybal says that his people will no longer have to track-down counselees. Instead, the student in need of help will have to go to them. Says he, "In the past, counselors were very busy tracking-down their students, but, with the new change-over now being planned, this problem is going to be eliminated." For further information, contact Felipe Roybal at Willard Hall, Room 331, 492-6391.
