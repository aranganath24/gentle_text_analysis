Media coverage unjust
Clapping hands and chanting "Viva la Raza” and "Chicano Power’’ is what I hear. Just one week prior I arrived in Boulder everyone thinking for a two week vacation, unknowing to everyone what was to come in the following weeks. The struggling events leading toward the take-over of TB-1 and eventually the horrifying death of five members of the Chicano community and one sympathizer of the Chicano community have been materializing for quite some time now. I am in no position to name these events as.l have only been here a month; I can only relate the actions I have seen. Upon my arrival, 1 immediately started to observe and see the oppression of the UMAS students but couldn't fully understand what was happening, until 1 started to talk to students who tried to explain the situation to me. May 15th expressed my feelings, meaning I felt my people were being oppressed by UMASEOP and action had to be taken. I was there during the first three hectic days! At approximately 9:55 p.m. May 27, an area bombing occurred. When 1 first heard this, it drastically scared me to think about anyone's death like that, but when I heard it was Neva Romero and Reyes Martinez, it hurt much, much more. 1 never knew Neva Romero or Reys too well and never met Una Jaakola, and when I learned about the second bombing on May 29 in which Florencio Granado, Herbierto Teran, and Francisco Dougherty I was pretty shooken up. Another very unfortunate victim was Antonio Alcantar, a Chicano from Tejas who may face criminal charges, while all the
tacts aren’t even out at this time. Antonio is under armed guard at Boulder Community Hospital. The majority of the Chicano community does not believe the news media has covered the explosions properly. We believe this is a great injustice to the six beautiful people who died, and to Antonio Alcantar. I may be only sixteen years old, but this is the way I feel and see things.
