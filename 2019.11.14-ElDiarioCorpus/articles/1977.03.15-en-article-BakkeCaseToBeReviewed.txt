On February 22, the United States Supreme Court voted to review a decision by the California Supreme Court which ruled that Special Admissions Programs were unconstitutional. This new development stems from the reverse discrimination suit filed by Allan Bakke against the University of California Regents. Bakke, who failed to gain admission to the UCDavid Medical School under regular admissions, applied under the Special Admissions program and was also denied admission. Bakke argued that his constitutional rights were being denied and that less qualified students than himself were being admitted.
