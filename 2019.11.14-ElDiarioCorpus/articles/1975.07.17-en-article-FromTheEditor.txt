From the Editor
El Diario is beginning a new phase of publishing. We will be presenting you, our readers, with more in depth reporting, and various other material you will find no where else. As in the past El Diario is supported only through advertisers, subscriptions and private contributions. Our main revenue comes from the advertisers, though, and therefore we are asking you to support those businesses that support us. To continue publishing we need your support
El Diario always welcomes those who wish to write, take pictures, or those who would just like to find out how a newspaper is run. Our office is located in the UMC 416. If you have any questions or contact us at University extension 8836 or 492-8836. El Diario Staff Ken Newton Carlos Garcia Donna Garcia James Jaramillo Leonard Martinez Editor Gloria Rubio
