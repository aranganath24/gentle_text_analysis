New Mexico Raza Unida announces candidatesThe New Mexico Raza Unida Party (RUP) announced that they will run Isabel Blea for governor of the state of New Mexico, Juan Jose Pena for the U.S. Senate and Larry Hill for attorney general in the 1978 election. At a news conference announcing the campaign, Blea, RUP state chairperson, pointed out that even though the states current governor, Jerry Apodaca, is a Chicano, the problems facing Chicanos here haven¡¯t been solved. She noted that Chicanos still suffer from racist education, poor housing, and high unemployment. Blea added that the allegiance of past governors has been to the rich who has financed their companies. The RUP is a party of working people, she explained, and her allegiance is to her supporters. Pena attacked the Democrats and Republicans for their indifference to New Mexico¡¯s working people. He said that the ¡°most critical problem¡± in the state is unemployment. He said he favored an open border with Mexico and unlimited immigration deporting undocumented workers, he said, creates ¡°a class of citizens who are essentially the same as slaves.¡± Full employment can be achieved Pena explained, by instituting a program of public works program would run up against a labor shortage. Blea added that New Mexico¡¯s rich natural resources should be tapped in such away as to benefit the states Chicanos, not just the big corporations. Pena will run against Apodaca, a Democrat, and incumbent Republican Pete Dominici.
