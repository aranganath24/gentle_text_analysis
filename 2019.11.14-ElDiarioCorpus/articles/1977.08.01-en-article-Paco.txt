PacoMrs. Garcia said she was tired of people making accusations without knowing the real story. People who never helped Paco were the first to criticize she said. People have forgotten the beautiful part of Paco accomplishments she said. ¡°Only the poor and elderly ever really cared for him¡± she said. He never got a penny for all the com-there were no buyers at that time. We negotiated with a group of Mexican Americans for a year but their financing fell through three weeks prior to the bank¡¯s closing. ¡°Closing the bank was a heart breaking thing. We knew the ramifications and bad publicity would come and that made it worse. A lot of low income investors whose only concern was to help Paco establish the bank lost their money. 1 lost $5,000 that I borrowed,¡± she said, munity work he did, but that was what he cared to do most. He loved it, and did it strictly as a service to his people,¡± she said.He sacrificed his family and his lite for his people, but Paco never did want to be praised she said. He did everything quietly and never got credit for it. ¡°Men like Paco are born not made Garcia said, ¡°We probably will never have another Paco. He was an extra special person God sent to us.¡±This scale model of a latino shopping center was to be Paco¡¯s next venture. Pictures; Courtesy of Christella Garcia
