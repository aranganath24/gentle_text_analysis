Puerto Rico; Statehood or IndependenceThe chances of Puerto Rico remaining a U.S. colony are almost impossible. The United Nations Decolonization Committee, a group made up of mostly Third World nations, is certain to end U.S. colonial influence on this Caribbean island. The $lO-40 billion copper and nickel reserves in Puerto Rico along with the recently discovered two billion barrels of oil found near the island is invaluable, and Puerto Rican Statehood would bring it under U.S. control. Being a commonwealth denies the islands full political rights.Low tax incentives have lured small companies such as electronics, pharmaceutical and shoe manufacturers to the island. Statehood would deter this, possibly forcing many to move, leaving the people unemployed and an economical collapse. Many believe there is a definite link between the oil and the statehood interest. Independence supporters believe the oil and other natural resources is the reason statehood advocates want to make Puerto Rico a state. The pro-independents fear the pro-statehooders will use the natural resources as the economic base to convince Congress Puerto Rico would not be a burden to the U.S. These same resources proindependents say can also be the base for the development of an independent Puerto Rican nation. The U.N. committee is likely to favor the independence advocates. Many committee members are from countries who were former colonies and involved in struggles to gain control of natural resources in their homelands.
