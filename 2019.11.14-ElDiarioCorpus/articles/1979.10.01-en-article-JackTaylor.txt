Judge dismisses civil suit against Jack Taylor
A civil suit, stemming from an article printed in the Valley Courier which allegedly defamed the character of Costilla Sheriff Ernesto Sandoval, was dismissed Sept. 26 by Judge Mastch in federal court. Sandoval claimed that Jack T. Taylor of Costilla County was negligent about speaking to a reporter of the Courier who quoted him in 1977 as saying, “No law is better than Sandoval’s law.” Judge Mastch based the dismissal on grounds that Sandoval is a "public official” and therefore is subject to public criticism. Under that law, if Taylor had been found intentionally negligent, the suit could have gone either way. In 1974, Sandoval and the County Commissioners of Costilla County tore down barricades that block off parts of land that Taylor bought in 1960. Taylor fenced the “mountain tract” which before his arrival was used by local residents for hunting, fishing, grazing, and collecting wood and water. Residents there claim that the land belongs to the people and they have documents to mow it.
