Greeley Chicanos seize building

As we go to press a dozen or more Chicanos are occupying the Weld County 
Opportunity Agency and say they intend to stay until their demands are met. Jose 
Calderon, a spokesman for the group, said he and the group from Fort Lupton wanted 
the immediate resignation of the agency's director Tom Medina. Calderon claims 
Medina has been insensitive to the needs of the poor people of the county and has 
mismanaged the OEO office. Early in the evening, it was believed Medina would resign 
to remove himself as an obstacle. He said, he felt there could be no settlement with the 
demonstrators because of “personalities" and hoped his resignation would pave the way 
for better relations between the agency and the group. The other demands included:
revamping of the 18-member board of directors to have 60 percent representation by 
the county’s poor; 20 percent by the local youth; and funding of a parent-child center. 
The chairman of the board who is also Greeley's mayor told the group he would call an 
emergency meeting "immediately.” The outsome of that meeting is also not known, but 
during the afternoon encounter, the Mayor indicated he supported the demands. During 
the occupation Calderon's group found evidence they say will prove the agency has 
misspent at least $50,000; has operated illegally by excluding Chicano representatives; 
and failed to serve the county’s poor. This latest clash climaxes two years of protest 
against the agency’s operation by Weld County's activists.
