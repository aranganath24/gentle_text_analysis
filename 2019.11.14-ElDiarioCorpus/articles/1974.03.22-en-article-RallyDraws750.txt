Rodolfo “Corky” Gonzales, head of the Crusade For Justice and Los Tres del Barrio, a politically oppressed trio from Los Angeles, were scheduled to speak, however, didn’t. Gonzales was suffering from strep throat and Los Tres were detained because the courts would not grant them permission to leave the State. Ernesto Vigil emphasized the • political repression of minorities and the poor in this country. He mentioned the Vietnam war and said it was not yet over because it was now at home. He was referring to last years’ March 17 confrontation with Denver Police and related incidents.Vigil criticized last month’s truckers strike, saying the poor were getting poorer because the “former rednecks and the former hardhats” were shutting-down the major hiways. He also made reference to Mrs. Nixon’s recent trip to Venezuela. He called the trip another means of pacifying the people. Vigil concluded his speech by extending an invitation to everyone to join in a solidarity march and rally held in Denver the 17th. Gary Garrison, an instructor at Escuela Tlatelolco, spoke mostly about his experience as a political prisoner. Garrison is accused of bombing a paint store in Denver. He called the charges against him, a “frame up.” Garrison said when he was arrested, police wanted him to admit to the bombing and in return numerous charges would be dropped against him, including second degree murder. “I’m not that dumb,” he said. Garrison is scheduled to appear in Denver District Court on June 10.
