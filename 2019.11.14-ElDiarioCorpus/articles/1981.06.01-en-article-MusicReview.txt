Review
Recently released from Columbia Records, Zebopl, Carlos Santana’s newest work. A combination of Marathon type rock ‘n’ roll plus a rebirth of his classical Latin beat. The first side of the album starts with a Cat Stevens song which has religious overtones; but is put to a strong rock beat. The first side contains the majority of rock style music that is good with the possible exception of the last cut “Winning.” “Winning,” for some reason, doesn’t quite fit the mood of Zebopl Side two of this new release is vintage Santana. A lot of conga and percussion give it a strong Latin flavor. Just like old times! On this side Santana does own version of JJ Cales “The sensitive kind” as if he wrote the song himself. Great! There is also a blues tune called “Brightest Star” that is powerful and moving. Alex Ligerwood, the vocalist, sounds as if he’s ready to cry. Moving! The best tunes, however, are the instrumentals and chants. They are very creative; even awesome. I give this new album by Santana a five star rating. In it his guitar work is flawless. There isn’t a rock guitarist that compares. Yes, that includes Clapton and Page! Considering all the trash that’; being released, Zebop! is very refreshing. Buy it!
