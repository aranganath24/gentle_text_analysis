REALIDADES, which is best translated as realities, was the first prime-time bilingual Latino public and cultural affairs series to be produced by public television. REALIDADES returns to Channel 6 with 10 all-new programs on Tuesday, July 19 at 11:00 p.m. This series of 30 minute programs examines the Latino experience in America. Each week a different reality of Latino life is the subject of documentary material shot on location in Latino communities across the country. Latino producers, filmmakers, technicians, and writers from across the nation have contributed ideas, scripts and program treatments; and Latino communities have had input through the ascertainment process. Subjects of programs this season include health care, bilingualism, voting rights, and the arts. The first program is entitled, Una nacion bilingue (A Bilingual Nation), and will focus on the need for bilingual services for the Spanish-speaking.
