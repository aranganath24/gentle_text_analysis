Aba jo con Agnews So Spiro Agnew, the champion of honesty, integrity, and law and 
order, has resigned. What a laugh. One of the most crooked of schemes has been 
played on the people of this country. A man, clean cut and all american, was given 
probation on one felony count of federal income tax evasion. The other 50 counts of 
bribery, extortion, and tax evasion were swept under the rug. Why wasn’t he jailed? 
Before Agnew was elected vice-president, the New York Times accused him of being 
involved in “clear and repeated conflicts of interest." His buddy, Nixon, immediately 
demanded that the paper withdraw the statement because the. charges were "stale”. 
The Times’ answered by printing the editorial again —.only to fall on deaf ears. When 
Agnew was accused of channelling county funds into a bank in which he was part 
owner, guess who justified his actions? Our hero of justice, John Mitchell. John was 
Attorney General at the time....how convenient. Remember what Agnew said about 
students? Remember what he felt towards minorities? Let’s never forget. Many people 
will forget Spiro Agnew soon. But in reality we are still surrounded by "Agnews". Nixoh 
and Mitchell are "Agnews". Wallace and Hoffa are “Agnews". Dale Tooley and Gino 
DiManna are “Agnews”. Quieren mas? Jose Ortega
