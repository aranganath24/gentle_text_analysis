Sandoval May Sue City
A former Boulder Police Officer was charged with third degree assault in the aftermath of an incident last week involving a Chicano University student. The officer, Russell Hyder, was fired from the Boulder Police Department Sept. 21 after a meeting between City Personnel Director Mike Patton and other city officials. The Chicano student, Roy Sandoval, 28, told the District Attorney's office that he had been beaten by Hyder while he was handcuffed at the police station
on 30th St. Sandoval had been taken to the police department after being involved in an altercation at a local restaurant. While being booked Sandoval reportedly became ‘abusive’ and allegedly kicked a chair. Hyder then allegedly hit Sandoval repeatedly. Hyder was tired after Patton determined that he had used “excessive force” in subduing Sandoval. Sandoval was unavailable for comment, but informed sources say that he may pursue legal action against the city government.
