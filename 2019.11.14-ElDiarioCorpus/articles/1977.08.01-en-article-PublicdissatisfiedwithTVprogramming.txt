Public dissatisfied with TV programmingResults of surveys taken nationally and locally (Denver) show that the public believes TV does not adequately serve the viewer. According to Federal Communications Commission (FCC) guidelines TV networks have a responsibility to devote time to some form of citizen access. TV stations across the country are increasingly becoming a daily part of peoples lives. The TV medium plays an intregal role in the molding and shaping of today¡¯s generation. Many of the viewers interviewed labeled TV as ¡°dumb and boring¡±.The national survey, conducted by the Committee for Open Media, showed that only 2.3% of all broadcast prime time was devoted to some sort of citizen access. The survey monitored 67 television stations across the country that reached about 45% of all Americans with television sets. In Denver, the Raza Association Of Media Advocates (RAMA) conducted a survey of Latino attitudes toward TV in regard to their community. Most of those interviewed alleged that television was unable to meet the needs of Latinos. Proper recognition to the Chicano community was not implemented in television news they said. Federal Communications Commission (FCC) guidelines require a fair and impartial presentation of the news. Many believe that the FCC fails to enforce this obligation. El Diario asked people how they felt about local coverage of TV news. The majority of these persons said the news was biased and didn¡¯t properly reflect those views of the general public. Channel 9 was picked as being the most racist. Carl Akers of Channel 9 was also unanimously picked as giving distorted and extremely biased commentaries.
