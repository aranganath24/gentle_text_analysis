Proposal submitted for Chicano majorA new proposal for an undergraduate major program in Mexican-American (Chicano) Studies has been submitted by Sal Ramirez, Chicano Studies director, for University action. Ramirez said the proposal is a modification of an earlier design for a Chicano Studies Department which was turned down by university administrators. "The university said there was no money for a Chicano Studies Department, so since then we’ve concentrated on hiring more Chicano professors and planning more Mex.-Am. classes,” Ramirez said. The original proposal, submitted in June of 1970, contained course descriptions and outlines. recruitmentprocedures for hiring professors to teach the courses, and was over 200 pages in length. 28 various courses were requested for the department. Presently 25 courses are offered in varying aspects of the world of La Raza, but university administrators have not appropriated enough funds for professors to teach the courses. Five Chicano faculty members are currently working at CU, but only four are teaching courses listed under Mex.-Am. Studies. Out of the 25 courses listed in the ’72-’73 Arts and Science bulletin for Chicano Studies, only 16 are now being offered because there are not enough professors to teach all 25 courses.In addition, five Chicano professors who were recruited have left CU for varying reasons, including better job offers and relocation problems with moving to Boulder. A Masters degree in Mexican-American Studies is now available at the university, but persons desiring an undergraduate major must travel to the University of Northern Colorado in Greeley. Ramirez plans to continue recruiting Chicano professors regardless of the University's actions on the proposal. “Chicano studies are an important part of any university,” Ramirez said, "and I'm firmly committed to getting a undergraduate degree in Chicano Studies for the students at CU."
