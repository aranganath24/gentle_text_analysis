Chicano - 'sense of unity & strength’ The word Chicano has been used by the Hispano-Spanish-Mexican-American people for years with both a good and bad interpretation. Lately it has been used to identify ourselves, our feeling for our culture, our pride in ourselves, and it provides us with a sense of unity and strength. However we sometimes find ourselves using Chicano as a kind of measuring stick. It has broken la raza into different groups, depending what we want to call ourselves. We began to waste our efforts as to what name we want to go under. We fail to recognize the unique diversity of the gente de Aztlan because we overshadow it with who is Chicano and who isn’t Some of us do not know the barrios, the campos, Spanish or even the correct pronunciation of Colorado. We may not want it this way but unfortunately this is the dilema society has set upon us. We show only our ignorance when we start calling each other sell outs, vendidos or lambes. What is most important is that we all come from a beautiful and dignified ancestory, and want to work to forward la raza. We all did not grow up experiencing the pride of being a part of la raza or knowing the power and sense of unity, of sharing a Chicano handshake with a carnal. What we must acquire now is patience. Patience to teach and share the love and pride we feel with those who have not yet broken through the social barrier that has entrapped their individuality of a strong breed of indio and Spanish. We must bring each other along and utilize our diversity in order to retain our beauty as a bronze nation. Carnales, the problems will always be there. Go out and tackle them; but do not forget your brothers who have not yet acquired the love and feelings you now possess. Be patient and be a teacher of the movement That is the strength of being Chicano.
