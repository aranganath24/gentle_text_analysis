Social security increase
Adjustments in the cost of living will be implemented by Social Security starting on July 1. Checks that are to be delivered starting from July 1 will increase to 5.9 percent for most people getting Social Security payments. The automatic cost-of-living provision was added to the Social Security law of 1972. This increase is due to the rise in consumer prices from the first 3 months of 1976 to the first 3 months of 1977. With the cost-of-living increase, the average social security retired, disabled, and widowed mothers or fathers with children in their care will receive the 5.9 increase in their checks at the first of the month.
