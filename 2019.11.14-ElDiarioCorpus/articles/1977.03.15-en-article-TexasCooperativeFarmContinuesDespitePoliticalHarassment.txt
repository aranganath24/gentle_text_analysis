A Texas Chicano cooperative farm dedicated to providing stability to its community will continue to operate despite attempts by Texas Politicians to have the farm dismantled. Attempts by the governor and other Texas officials to destroy the Chicano community owned farm were halted when the federal
government issued a $67,000 check to continue operation of the farm. Federal officials ignored remarks by Gov. Dolph Briscoe, claiming the farm project was un-American and un-Texan, and proceeded to pay on the original $1.5 million grant. The Zavala County Economic Development Corporation, which handles the farm, was developed by the independent Chicano Raza Unida party. 200 more jobs will be created for area poor when the farm is in full operation. These jobs will mean less residents will have to follow the crops around the country for employment. In addition to Briscoe labeling the project a little Cuba on Texas soil, the Texas administration revoked the state charter of the development corporation. The corporations appeal is pending. Last fall Briscoe initiated a campaign that was successful in freezing the corporation funds for several months. A loss incurred by the
corporation during this time was the attempted purchase of 1,500 additional acres. The farm begins salaries at $2.50 an hour, double the minimum wage of Texas farm workers. Many believed this to be the major reason why Briscoe, a large South Texas landowner, opposes the project.
