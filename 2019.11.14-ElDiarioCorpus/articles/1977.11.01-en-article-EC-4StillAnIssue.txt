EC-4 Still An IssueEC-4, a bill which threatens continued funding of student groups at the University of Colorado has been voted on for over a month now. But even though the bill hasn¡¯t been implemented into action, the Student Coalition, a group of 13 student organizations have prepared themselves to continue to battle against it. Coalition members plan to take the issue to the UCSU (student government) Court of Appeals in order to abolish EC-4. Another avenue to do away with the bill would come in the form of a UCSU election for the general student populace to decide the bill¡¯s fate. The organizing of a mass University general assembly is still another method being looked at to defeat EC-4.EC-4 in its complete form would allow students to decide whether they want their student fees to finance various student groups. The bill would require checkoff boxes for individual groups on student registration cards. By not checking the box, students would still not receive a full rebate of their $1.60 fee. It would be placed in a general student fund. Many groups funded by this $1.60 fee are minority groups, and to restructure the funding process could greatly reduce monies needed by these groups. These groups have added to the diverse college atmosphere through guest speakers, cultural events, conferences and a variety of other activities.A problem seen by Coalition members with the check off system is since minorities make up such a small portion of the total campus population, minority groups in all likelihood would receive a small amount of any funds distributed. For months the UCSU ignored logical, organized, well reasoned arguments presented by the student Coalition for the bill¡¯s defeat. However the issue culminated by a disturbance following the passage of EC-4 at the September 29 UCSU meeting. Many believe the frustration of the people due to the repeated indifference on the part of the Council to the popular mandate of the people triggered the incident.
