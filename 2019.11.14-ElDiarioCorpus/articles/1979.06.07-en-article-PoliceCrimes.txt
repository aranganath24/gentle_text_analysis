Police Crimes

Disputes over the use of deadly force by police were a major source of racial unrest in the U.S. last year, a Justice Department report has disclosed. Of the many thousand reports of police brutality last year, considerably more than 400 involved the death of a minority, yet police departments throughout the country are requesting less stringent restrictions on when they can use a gun. On may 10, Cincinnati policemen went on a one-day strike calling for .357 cal. handguns, shotguns on the dashboards of patrol cars, a return of the death penalty in Ohio, and among other things, fewer restrictions on when an officer could use his gun. While politicians eat their campaign promises of coordinating efforts to smash police crime, the urban barrios and rural communities confront socio-economic and racial discrimination as a daily nightmare. For some people this is unrealistic because in their particular neighborhoods they are not exposed to this kind of experience. And why shouldn’t there be more crime found in barrios there are so many more cops. This recent incident of Joe Rodriguez (see story on page 2) is not a unique story. Pofirio Jaramillo of Center, Colorado was also shot and killed last year, and there have been many more, some of which we have never heard about or that have been justified by this country’s courts. We (should) need only to look at a few cases of police crime to comprehend the system’s system.
