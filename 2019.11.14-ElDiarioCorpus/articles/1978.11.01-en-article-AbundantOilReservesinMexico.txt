Abundant Oil Reserves in Mexico

by Jorge Esleve

Mexico For nearly two years the Carter Administration has known, but kept secret, the fact that Mexico has proven oil reserves amounting to 31 billion barrels, not 3.5 billion as the administration has led us to believe. The same CIA study says Mexico has additional "probable" reserves amounting to nearly 200 billion barrels. Saudi Arabia, which was thought to have the world's largest reserves, has an estimated 170 billion barrels. U.S. officials, who asked not to be identified, and revealed the figures on Mexican oil, said they believe the administration wanted the information concealed from the American public for fear of jeopardizing it’s energy policy. Carter's much criticized policy is built around the supposed energy shortage in the 1980's. With the entrance of Mexico into the oil game the Arab dominated oil cartels grip on world petroleum could be broken. By 1982 Mexico could be producing 4 to 5 million barrels a day, (quite a feat considering that 5 years ago Mexico was importing oil). Not only will Mexico’s oil help the U.S. cut its dependence on Arab oil, but it is also more economical to transport oil from Mexico than to pay 10 times the cost by transporting oil from the Persian Gulf, but more importantly Mexico will be eligible for absolute economic dependency.
