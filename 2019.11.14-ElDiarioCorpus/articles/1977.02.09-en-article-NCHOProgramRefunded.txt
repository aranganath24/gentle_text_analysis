Funding for a National Chicano Health Organization (NCHO) instructional program has been refunded for 1977. The instructional or percep torship program will place Chicano and Chicana medical students at sites with a predominant Chicano population that have a medical manpower shortage. Students that participate in the six to nine week program will work with National Health Service Corps physicians and health professionals. Students will receive pay for their involvement.
