Medicine Man Image Libeled by Bar Slogan FRANK BLACK ELK, Director of the American Indian Movement in Colorado, has contacted the owner of a “new" bar in Golden, Colorado, to express disgust and anger about the bar’s name and slogan. The bar's name: THE MEDICINE MAN BAR. The slogan: “GOTUM CURE FOR YOU AT MY TEEPEE." FRANK BLACK ELK told Mr. Simon the name and slogan were degrading and insulting to Native Americans’ culture, heritage, and national pride. Mr. Simon said he couldn't see why. FRANK BLACK ELK is urging all Native Americans who seek to maintain cultural and racial pride in America, to write your Congressmen and State Legislatures, OR whoever you think can help in this situation. FRANK BLACK ELK is developing literature for a bill prohibiting the State from granting a liquor license to an establishment which intentionally or unintentionally discriminates against a cultural unit or a specific segment of our society. IF YOU ARE interested in helping FRANK BLACK ELK and other Native Americans stopping Mr. Simon and preventing a reoccurrence of such a blatent disrespect and mockery of Native Americans, contact Bruce Woodhull, rm. 212, Willard.
