Gente gathered at parks this week to welcome another summer. Sunday, June 12, 1977, a food drive concert consisting of seven bands at Adams County Fair Grounds, strummed and harmonized with a crowd of over 1000 people. Starting at 1:00 till sunset people came in with their food donations for the Migrant Counsel program which is very needy because of the severe drought this year. Migrants from many states come in annually. With sweat and blood they put the food on our tables, but being an unusual year, it is our time to help them out. With thanks to Archuleta Productions for their hospitality, we are reaching more goals in our struggle. Adams County Fair grounds
