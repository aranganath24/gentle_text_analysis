Right to work law debatedRepeal of section 148 of the Taft-Hartley act has been a public issue for months and will continue to be so. Although not heavily publicized, 148 allows individual states to pass laws that forbid unions and employers from bargaining over union security. Ironically 148 states are called ¡°right to work states.¡± The basic idea behind unionization is the requirement of every worker to be protected by a contract, and to prevent being undermined by the employer. Union dues assure its function and make it strong enough to live up to the terms of the contract. Workers profit from better representation of a secure union and the knowledge that all workers are paying their share toward costs of a union. Government has assigned specific obligations to unions which they are legally bound to. Unions must provide equal protection to all, even members opposed to it. This obligation is enforced through the labor board and the courts. Union members who are opposed are provided with an opportunity to fight within the union itself, a common occurrence. Through petitions, changes can democratically be made. Much of union dues are spent on direct trade union activities, negotiations, administration, grievance procedure, organizing, staff training, compiling data, etc. Beyond this, education, social security, medicare, minimum wages, unemployment insurance, housing, hospitals and more are all important to the well being of the workers.
