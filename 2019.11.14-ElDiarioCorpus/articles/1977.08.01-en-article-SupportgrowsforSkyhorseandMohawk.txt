Support grows for Skyhorse and MohawkThe national Council of Churches has issued a nationwide appeal on behalf of Paul Skyhorse and Richard Mohawk, two American Indian Movement activists being tried for murder in Los Angeles. Lucius Walker, associate general secretary of the council, brands the charges a frame-up and appeals for financial support to the defense. His letter notes that the decision of his governing board to endorse the case was unanimous.In taking this step, the National Council of Churches joins a growing number of groups and individuals who are registering their support for Skyhorse and Mohawk. One indication of this is that each day supporters of the defense fill the spectators¡¯ section of the courtroom. Invariably they include people who have previously experienced and fought political and racist frame-ups.Skyhorse and Mohawk with attorneys
