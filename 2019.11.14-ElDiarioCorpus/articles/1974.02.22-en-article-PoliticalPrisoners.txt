Political prisonersPolitical Prisoners In the Constitution we are guaranteed freedom of speech and equal representation but when our people seek these rights we are condemned. It becomes more obvious to us that the law is set up to protect only a select group. For example, a young Chicano, Luis "Junior" Martinez, was killed and the murderer, a police officer, was not tried. Mario Vasquez is now serving time in Buena Vista for allegedly assaulting three police officers. Kiki Navarro, a young Chicana was sentenced to three years at the Morrison Home for attempting to form a Chicano organization in the high schools. Mario and Kiki represent thousands of people who speak out against racist actions against the deprivation of a people. The mere fact that Chicanos and other minorities exist creates negative reactions from those who control our lives. So we must align ourselves with Kiki and Mario because they are a part of us and personally suffering the injustices of the court system and of this entire way of life which is imposed on us. We also recognize and support our brothers and sisters throughout the land who are punished for allegedly condemning human injustices. Unidos venceremos.
