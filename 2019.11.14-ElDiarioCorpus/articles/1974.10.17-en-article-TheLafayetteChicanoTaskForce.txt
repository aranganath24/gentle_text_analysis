The Lafayette Chicano Task Force showed up to support Boulder County Mental Health Worker Pete Garcia last week when it was rumored he might be dismissed. The executive board of the Mental Health Center rescinded Garciaâ€™s probation. Garcia is a member of the county school board and has been recognized as a leading proponent of bilingual education.
