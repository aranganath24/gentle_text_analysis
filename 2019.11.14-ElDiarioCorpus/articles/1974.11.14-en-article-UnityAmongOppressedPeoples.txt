Unity among oppressed peoples
The two basic points expressed at the day of solidarity with Puerto Rico in New York were: (1) that we, the oppressed peoples, must unite and (2) that we must all fight against the common enemy. Representing Aztlan was Rudolfo “Corky” Gonzales, of the Crusade for Justice. He talked about Chicanos and Puertorriquenos having much of the same history of oppression by the same people. He talked about the struggle against el Yanqui and about being part of occupied Puerto Rico and Manhattan. Corky said “We are controlled by this society and the corporate structure. We must take things into our own hands. Anything worth living for is worth dying for and anything worth dying for is worth living for. Somos companeros en la lucha, la lucha de liberacion de Puerto Rico y tod os los mundos de tercer mundo.” He ended with a chant: BoriqueChicano luchando mano en mano. Another speaker Vinie Burrows, an actress, director, and producer who has staged seven one-woman theatre productions including the critically acclaimed “Walk-Together Children,” talked about how a Black, Puerto Rican, Chicano, or Native American child can be twisted and torn by American society. “But we are strong and we shall pass that strength on to our children so that they not only survive, but they will overcome.” Russell Means represented the American Indian Movement He began by welcoming everyone to Indian land. He talked about freedom and said that the Indian people never made the mistake of losing their freedom; they are still free. “Puerto Rican and Chicano people share the same ancestors; we must remember that. We share their same beliefs — independence and freedom." He talked about the Indian peoples spirituality, about four colors: red for the East, Black for the west, yellow for the south, and white for the north. He said, “Mix all these colors together and you get brown which is the color of our mother earth and our color. He then quoted Chief Seattle: “TRIBE FOLLOWS TRIBE AND NATION FOLLOWS NATION. IT IS LIKE THE WAVES OF THE SEA; IT IS THE ORDER OF NATURE AND REGRET IS USELESS. YOUR TIME OF DECAY MAY BE DISTANT, BUT IT WILL SURELY COME. FOR EVEN THE WHITE MAN’S GOD WHO WALKED AND TALKED WITH HIM AS FRIEND WITH FRIEND COULD NOT ESCAPE THE COMMON DESTINY. WE MAY BE BROTHERS AFTER ALL, WE SHALL SEE!” There were many many more speakers, but in my mind these were the most important Once again I’d like to say that everyone was calling for unity among all oppressed peoples of the world. TTiis is one of the answers for our struggle in order to gain our liberation. Juntos Venceremos! Cinthia Carrillo
