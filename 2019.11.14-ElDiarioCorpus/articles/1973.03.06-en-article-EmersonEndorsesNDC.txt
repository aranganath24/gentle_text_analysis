Emerson endorses NDC
Dear Editor: The purpose of this letter is to give my wholehearted endorsement to Paul Boetcher, Patti Price, Jess Vigil, and the entire New Directions slate. Since Paul, Patti, and Jess will be tripartite presidents I asked for an appointment as their vice president. They turned me down. I am disappointed, but I still think NDC is the way to go in this election. Noting NDCâ€™s past accomplishments is secondary concerning why they should be elected. The prime reason is that they are truly the best ones for the job. Sincerely, Sonny Emerson ASUC Vice President
