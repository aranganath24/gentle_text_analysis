Center needs donations
Westside Action Center held an open house for the public to view emergency housing situation in Denver area, Thursday, Sept. 26. Betty Koehler who coordinates the emergency housing unit has been involved in tenants rights for the past three years. The facility is one of a few in Denver that assists families with no money for food or rent. Located at 1100 Santa Fe, the unit has seven rooms and a small play-ground. Cooking facilities are limited to hot plates and electric skillets. Terry Haynes a tenant in the unit arrived from California, divorced; with no money; and six children. She was referred there by the Denver Housing Administration and feels she has benefited from the experience. Armando Ayala arrived in Denver from Texas with his wife and five children. Knowing very little English he had a problem employment. He was also a victim of a burglary where in his first apartment everything was stolen. He is now attending English classes and is being aided by welfare. “These are the problems that people are faced with everyday,” Betty said. “Still many more families must be turned down; with only seven rooms it's impossible to meet the ever-increasing need for housing”.
Needed are linens, hot plates, refrigerators and toys. Anyone can assist by donating such items to the Westside Action Center 1 100 Santa Fe.
