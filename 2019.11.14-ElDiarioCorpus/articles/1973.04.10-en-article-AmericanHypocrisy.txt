American hypocrisyPardon me, America, your racism is showing. Last week’s national meat boycott brought to light many interesting points. Americans everywhere participated in a secondary boycott in an attempt to curb sky-rocketing food prices. Meanwhile, back at the statehouses, Colorado included, legislators attempt to pass legislation calling for an end to secondary boycotts. Many of those participating in the meat boycott are in favor of the legislation to prevent the United Farm Workers Union from organizing. The manner in which pickets were received also seems to say something. In Colorado Springs about three weeks ago, 23 UFW supporters (including 3 priests and 4 nuns) were arrested at a Safeway store. At that same Safeway store, housewives picketing in favor of the meat boycott were served coffee and donuts by the store. The American morality appears to be based on the worship of the dollar. If you are protesting to save your own bank account, everyone identifies with you, but if you are boycotting lettuce or Safeway to help some poor migrant worker you don’t even know, then Americans question your intentions. The meat boycott is to the bank book what the lettuce boycott is to your Karma, so try it, you’ll like it.
