Chicana poet to recite works on TV

Women today are becoming aware that they share a common experience and history. TURNABOUT presents poet Carol Lee Sanchez who draws on her multi-cultural background to mirror experiences common to us all. “Common Ground,” seen on Friday, December 22 at 9:30 p.m. on Channel 6, also features animator Faith Hubley and her Film, Women of the World. Ms. Sanchez’ heritage combines American Indian and Chicano. Her poetry reflects her roots as well as a childhood spent on a reservation outside Albuquerque, New Mexico. TURNABOUT returns with her to the Southwest where she reads some of her poetry and explores the area that inspired it. Although Ms. Sanchez now lives in San Francisco, California, she has kept her connection with her past. She says the changes of rhythm in her work draw on the Spanish and Laguna and Acoma Indian dialects she heard while growing up. Some of her poems use Indian rhythms including the cadence of drumbeats and the ceremonial chant cycles. In her film, animator Faith Hubley also shows women bonded

by a common history and experience. She and her late husband, John, have won many honors including three Academy Awards. Her work is shown

extensively on public television programs such as SESAME STREET. TURNABOUT repeats Saturday at 7:30 p.m.
