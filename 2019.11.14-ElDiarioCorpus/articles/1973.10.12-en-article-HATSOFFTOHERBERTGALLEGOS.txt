HATS OFF TO HERBERT GALLEGOS

From Lis Chicano Kids Herbie! Herbie! Herbie! You always continue to amaze us with 
your kind and thoughtful concern for we poor unfortunate Chicanos whom you feel 
cannot fend for themselves. How lucky we are to have you! We’re grateful to you for 
sticking your keen private eye nose into the Financial Aid matter. Bet for that caper you 
got a few brownie points and a pat on the back from our friends at Regent Hall. Enough 
is enough Herb, we're tired of seeing you with that tremendous load on your back, so 
believe it or not, we have now developed a Financial Aid Committee. This committee 
consists of over fifty members and is designed to take over where you screwedup. No 
need to thank us Herb..it’s the least we can do. Without someone like you to inspire us, 
we would have never carried out that successful rally and march to Regents. What a 
beautiful demonstration that was, eh Herb? Remember Jess Vigils’ hearing before the 
disciplinary committee? Well it seems that the people who testified against Jess were 
more to his advantage. You do know he was acquitted don’t you? We’re very sad that 
you didn't get the chance to testify also. We’re sure that your testimony would have 
been as good, if not better, than those who did. Oh well, why cry over spilt milk, you’ll 
get your chance to spill the beans (you do eat beans?) when Jess has to appear in 
County Court. The District Attorny is counting on you to show your support. With luck he 
might have a few more brownie points to add to your collection. It’s conforting to know 
that one day, we as Chicanos, can sit back and say, it’s boys like Herbert Gallegos, with 
his capitol ideas, make this country what it is today. Lousy! Keep up the good work 
Herb, brother Birch loves you.
