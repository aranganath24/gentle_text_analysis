Summer curriculum to include Soc 111The purpose of the course is to introduce the student to major theorists, theories, concepts and terminology in the field of Sociology. The approach will be grounded in the Chicano experience by attempting to exemplify sociological thought through application to Chicanos as interpreted by a Chicano sociologist. The course is first and foremost an introductory course in Sociology. The major difference between the course as taught for the Summer Program and the same course as taught during the Fall and Spring semesters is that every effort will be made to relate the content of Sociology to barrio life. What appears to be difficult material is better understood when the instructor puts the idea in context of examples relating to our lives as Chicanos. This will be the guiding principle for the course. However, the content will be the substance of Sociology. The course was created for practical reasons. One is that most Chicanos eventually become Sociology majors, and eventually have to take Introduction to Sociology. The major problem with having to take, the course during the regular year is that the course is usually taught by an Anglo professor who either knows very little about Chicanos and/or makes very little effort in relating the material to Chicanos. Under the circumstances, most Chicanos either drop the course or remain in it only to receive a "CONDITIONAL'' or wind up with a grade of “C” or below. This occurs not because Chicanos do not know the material, but because the instructor cannot relate sociological concepts to the Chicano’s cultural reality.
