Pinto Contest
Due to the positive response El Diario received concerning the two pinto compositions that appeared in last month's issue, El Diario is now sponsoring a pinto creations contest. In a future edition, the staff plans to devote an entire section to our brothers and sisters behind bars. The section will contain whatever creations that you may wish to contribute to our people. The prize that we have to offer is a year's subscription to all who's work is used, plus official recognition as a contributor to the newspaper. Who is eligible for the contest? The staff of El Diario realizes that the experiences and memories of a pinto last a life time, so all pintos, past and present are invited to enter. What type of work is eligible? Any original poetry or writing are invited such as the article and poem in last month's issue and the author will either be acknowledged or kept anonymous, as you wish. It should be noted that rather short works of 300 to 500 words will have a better chance of winning. Original art is also invited. Simple drawings, sketches, and designs are preferable, such as ideas for tattoos, person's bodies or faces, cars, animals, and simple landscapes. Remember that black ink on white paper reproduce best. So tell your friends to mail their contributions to the address below, make sure to include your name and address just in case you're a, winner. Also, please indicate if you need to have your original returned. Mail to:
