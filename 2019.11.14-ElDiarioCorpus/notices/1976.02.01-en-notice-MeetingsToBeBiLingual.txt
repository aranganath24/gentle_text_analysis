meetings to be bilingualUMAS Board of Directors Chairman, Leo Lobato says he plans to initiate some changes within the organization. Among other things, Lobato hopes to conduct Board meetings and General Assemblies in both Spanish and English. Lobato says it’s time to “go bilingual.” He believes the change will benefit the student by allowing him to exercise his ability to speak Spanish. Lobato has other reasons for the proposed change. “We’ve been highly criticized by Anglos,” he said. “They believe we, as a Chicano organization, should conduct our business Chicano style.” Other changes include redefining the roles and responsibilities of committees directly accountable to the Board. Each committee will be required to outline a course of action. Lobato wants to see more “high risk” students entering the university, and encourages others to get involved with the organization. “People can learn a lot,” he said. “They can learn things that can help them throughout their careers.”
