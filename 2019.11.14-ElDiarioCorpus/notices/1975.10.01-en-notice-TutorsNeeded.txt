TUTORS NEEDEDTutors are needed that are interested in working with Chicano children between six and 12 years of age. Persons are mostly needed in the areas of Math, English, History and Reading. Almost anyone can tutor, so if you can spare a couple of hours a week to help these kids call 449-7667, ask for Darlene.
