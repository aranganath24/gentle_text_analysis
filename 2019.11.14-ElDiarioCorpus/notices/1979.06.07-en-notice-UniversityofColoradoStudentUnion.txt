University of Colorado Student Union The UCSU (student government) needs your help so we can help you. Sound like a contradiction? Well, we had your help this spring, when over 7000 students turned out for a rally that helped to blunt the state’s budget cuts. It’s not over yet. We still need your help to recover what was lost and save what’s left after the JBC cuts are made. Meanwhile, other issues have come up, and we need your help on those, too. For example, student government autonomy is being put to the test. Without autonomy, students’ rights to see where their money is spent would go down the drain. Volunteers are an integral part of the UCSU. The working arms of the government commissions and Joint Boards are doing important work this summer to help you. Talk to anyone in the UCSU offices, UMC 334, about how you can help. We can do it with you. We can’t do it without you. UCSU
