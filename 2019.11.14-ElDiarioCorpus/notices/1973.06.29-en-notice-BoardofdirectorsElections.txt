Board of Directors Elections 
This is to inform prospective candidates of the date change for the Board of Directors Elections. The main reason for the change is to give the students who are elected a little more time to be in office since their term will end when the summer session ends. THE NEW DEADLINE for all petitions will be 5:00 p.m., Friday, June 29. All petitions must be turned into the UMAS Office, UMC, Room 1 87 by that time. On Monday, July 2 at 7:00 p.m. there will be a UMAS meeting. At that time candidates will be given an opportunity to be introduced and say a few words. Elections will be held Friday, July 6 from 9-5 in the UMAS Office, UMC, Room 187. Some type of identification will be needed at that time. Students who are elected will be expected to be at the next Board of Directors meeting July 9. Muchas Gracias, Sharon J. Vigil Election Official
