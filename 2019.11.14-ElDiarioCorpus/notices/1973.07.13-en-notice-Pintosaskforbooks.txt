Pintos ask for books 
Books dealing with Chicanos, including our history, culture, politics, etc., are being collected for use by prisoners in the Canyon City penitentiary. The books are being collected by members of the St. Thomas Aquinas Newman Center, located at 904 14th Street in Boulder. If you can donate books of your own, or help locate books for the pintos, bring them to the Newman Center.
