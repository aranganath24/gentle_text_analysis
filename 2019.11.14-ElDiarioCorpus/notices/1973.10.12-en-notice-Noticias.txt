Bulletin!! Student organizations were granted an indefinite extension concerning their 
work-study student employees. At Wednesday’s meeting with Vice President Corbridge, 
ASUC lawyer William Gray requested a continuation of the status quo. Because 
Corbridge was unsure about what the federal guidelines meant, he agreed to wait until 
the University receives an opinion from Regional Director of Education, Louis Crumbs, 
before deciding whether the work-study students will be transferred. According to Tri-
executive Jess Vigil, Corbridge’s attitude at this meeting was “quite different” than in the 
past. Vigil attributed the attitude change to the presence of Lawyer Gray.
