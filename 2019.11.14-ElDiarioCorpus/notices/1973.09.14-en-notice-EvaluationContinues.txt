Evaluation continues

There are over 1300 courses, with around 4000 sections offered by the University. How 
does one know what courses to choose? How does one know the degree of difficulty 
associated with each certain course? How does one know which courses are bad and 
which are worthwhile taking? The ASUC-proposed course evaluation can be a valuable 
tool for this task, and it is on the way. The ASUC student government is attempting to 
put together a comprehensive course evaluation comprised of criticisms and opinions of 
courses, and written by students. Students will be able to evaluate and critique the 
courses they are taking this semester, thus providing information for students who wish 
to take those courses in the future. The course evaluation committee, headed by 
Debbie Veals and Beth Travis, has prepared a questionnaire to be distributed in all 
classes the week before Thanksgiving vacation. The evaluation is patterned after a 
similar effort at Boston University. Volunteers are needed to help distribute the 
questionnaires in classes. In addition, editors are needed for the various schools in the 
University and chairmen of specific departments are also needed. Of special interest to 
the evaluation is input from minority students. 

Through the evaluation, students will be able to provide insights into the attitudes of faculty 
who may not treat minority students fairly. It is hoped that the booklet can be compiled 
and printed by this spring and available to students for registration this spring, for next 
fall's courses. It will prove itself to be a valuable aid for incoming freshmen and 
continuing University students. Through the cooperative efforts of many students, the 
ASUC Course Evaluation Booklet is well on it's way toward being a reality. Those 
persons interested in volunteering time and efforts to this project can contact Debbie 
Veals or Beth Travis at ext. 7473 or in the ASUC offices in the UMC. The evaluation is 
an opportunity for the student to expose to his fellow students which faculty members 
have these types of attitudes. It is also a chance for a student to deliver the praise he 
thinks other professors might deserve. Although there is a present system of course 
evaluation, the ASUC course evaluation will be the first student written evaluation for 
the use of students. The present course evaluation is for the use of University 
departments only, and is not made available for the use of students.
