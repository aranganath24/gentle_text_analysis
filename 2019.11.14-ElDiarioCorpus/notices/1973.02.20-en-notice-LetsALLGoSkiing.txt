Let’s ALL go skiing
We understand UMAS-EOP and Concentrated Service will be sponsoring another ski trip this next weekend. If we sound vague, it’s because we have not been notified of the event. In fact we have never been asked to notify you, the students, of any of the past ski trips. However, we are certain this is an oversight on the part of the sponsors. Since the skiing season is rapidly coming to an end, we hope some new students will be able to take advantage of upcoming trips. We applaud the UMAS administrations attempt to offer students activities of this kind which they generally are not able to afford. But, like all UMAS activities, we feel these events should be better publicized, to enable ALL students to participate. We encourage all students interested in going on one of the upcoming ski trips to contact Dave Givens at TB 1. If more students show an interest than is economically feasible to accommodate, we feel certain those who have already had the experience will step aside and let a brother give it a try.
