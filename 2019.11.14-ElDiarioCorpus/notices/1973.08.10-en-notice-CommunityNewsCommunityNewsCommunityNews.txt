Access to Migrant Camps Protected 

Michael Fox, A Legal Services Attorney, and Guadalupe Gamboa, A United Farmworker 
Union (UFWU) organizer entered the property of Rogers Labor Camp, near Walla 
Walla, Washington, to speak with migrant workers. They were arrested by the 
deputy sheriff pursuant to the request of the supervisor of Rogers. They were convicted 
for trespassing by the Superior Court for Walla Walla County, and appealed to the 
Supreme Court of Washington. The issue in this case was whether the First and 
Fourteenth Amendment rights include the right to counsel in a migrant camp situation. 
The court found that under applicable Supreme Court decisions, that right did not exist. 
With regard to Gamboa, the court based its decision on labor law principles. The court 
held “that a union organizer has a right to go where necessary to meet with workers, as 
long as his exercise of that right is reasonable. The right here was exercised outside of 
working hours, and during the daytime.” Mario Obledo, of the Mexican American Legal Defense Fund (MALDEF) 
General Counsel, participated in the trial and appeal of this case. After hearing of the 
reversal of the convictions, he stated, “Chicanos in the Pacific Northwest are beginning 
to organize themselves for bettering their economic condition in farming areas. This 
case will ensure that the workers will have access to those people who will be able to 
help them make decisions on their economic rights.” Pueblo Job Vacancy Southern

WASHINGTON Organizations with special ability to reach Hispanic Americans and other minority group 
members with information on jobs and training opportunities are listed in a new 
publication of the Manpower Administration, U.S. Department of Labor. The “Directory 
for Reaching Minority Groups” lists Federal, state and local governmental units, 
community-action agencies, educational institutions, fraternities and sororities, press-
broadcast media, religious, minority organizagionts, and state apprenticeship agencies. 
The organizations and individuals are listed alphabetically by State and city, with the 
address and telephone number for each. The 214-page directory, compiled by the 
Bureau of Apprenticeship and Training (BAT), is based on information received from 
Operation SER (Service, Employment, Redevelopment), League of United Latin 
American Citizens (LULAC), American G.I. Forum, and other minority group 
organizations across the country. Single copies may be obtained from the Office of 
Information, Manpower Administration, U. S. Department of Labor. Washington, D. C.

Media Input At a time when minorities are finally shaking primitive American societal mores, 
developing, incorporating and identifying with their distinct cultural values, ideals and 
pride, it becomes exceedingly important for minority students in higher education to 
have the chance to link their education (particularly research) to practical necessities in 
their communities. While the student not only enhances his education by doing such 
research, he also has the chance to be able to see some of his work go beyond the 
professors’ desk with the possibility of some or all of the work implemented in some 
manner to serve his community. The Colorado Committee on the Mass Media and the 
Spanish Surnamed is a group of Chicano professionals working in the Denver area 
media. We are dealing with the gap in Denver’s minority programming and hiring 
practices in the media industry. Currently we are working with various broadcasters in 
an attempt to ascertain the needs of the Denver minority communities in an effort to 
create, recommend and implement programming reflective of these needs. Many of 
these stations have their licenses up for renewal in April, 1974, and this research would 
be in regard to the station's practices in regard to Denver’s minorities. We are inquiring 
into the possibility of establishing separate independent research projects for interested 
students. Although there is particular information relevant to us, we in no way have no 
desires of dictating specifications on the individual.

Obviously there is a plethora of information and research possibilities in this area. We 
are interested in establishing a program where the student can obtain a certain number 
of hours credit through your school (dependent upon the amount of time spent on the 
project, and the final product research paper). We are willing to provide all the contacts 
that would be necessary for the student, and a limited amount of funds for raw 
expenses (gas and food). Hopefully the research, its implications, school credit, and 
contacts will provide the impetus for the intricacies to be worked out between you and 
us. Particulary we are interested in minority students who hold interests of future 
professionalwork in any media. We are trying to give a student the chance to become 
familar with the day to day surroundings of particular stations. We also are approaching 
you with the idea that possibly such research and contact with a particular station could 
lead to future employment of the researcher in a structured internship program with his 
source. Specifically, we are approaching you with the inquiry as to what the specific 
procedures are to establish such a program. We are looking forward to working with you 
to implement such a program. Your fast reply is greatly appreciated. Send all
