Recruit A Brother! Dear Hermanos y Hermanas, I am requesting your help in recruiting Chicano students to the University of Colorado UMAS-EOP Program. Despite the fact that recruiting was discontinued for a period of three (3) weeks last November, applications have been coming in at a fairly good rate. However, it is difficult to determine whether this is because there are more students applying or whether they are just applying earlier. Nevertheless, I need your help. How can you help? If you know of someone who is or might be interested in coming to University of Colorado under EOP-M or EOP-MAP please give me his or her name and address, telephone number if possible. I would then follow up with a letter and application. I would also expect you to follow up during the Spring Break. Use the form below and return to my office: Regent 205, campus. Muchas Gracias. Thomas Trujillo Admissions Office. I suggest that you send EOP Admissions information to: Name. Telephone. Address. State. Zip. State. Zip. Name. Address. State. Zip. City. Telephone. State. Zip.
