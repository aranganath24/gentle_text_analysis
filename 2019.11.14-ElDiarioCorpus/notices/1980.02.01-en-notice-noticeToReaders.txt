NOTICE TO READERS
As part of its reorganization, El Diario's mailing list will require a complete change. Beginning in May, the paper will be sent only to those readers who fill out and send in the order! Blank below. Subscription rates will be $5.00 for institutions (schools, libraries...), $3.00 for individuals. In order to achieve this goal of reaching as many interested readers as possible, El Diario will be sent to all who return the order blank with a donation of whatever they can afford to spend -- either more or less than the $3.00. Act quickly and return the order blank so your delivery will not be interrupted.
