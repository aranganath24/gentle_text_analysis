Boycott Gallo Wines! A desperate battle for human dignity, social justice, and 
agricultural unionization is currently being fought in the fields of California. For the last 
decade, the United Farm Worker Union has struggled to unite agricultural workers into 
an effective union under the leadership of Cesar Chavez, himself a former campesino 
(farmworker). Only the United Farm Worker Union provides regulations protecting 
workers from pesticide poisoning, maintains provisions for defending workers from 
unemployment due to agricultural mechanization, establishes medical benefits (Robert 
F. Kennedy Medical Plan), eliminates the use of the labor contractor, and institutes a 
hiring hall which ensures seniority rights and employment soley on the basis of technical 
competence. Current Teamster sweetheart contracts which summon the labor 
contractor to act as the union structure in the fields, handling grievances and 
implementing union provisions and to supply labor for the growers are in opposition to 
the sociopolitical interests of the farm worker; his right to create an effective union 
organization. In 1970 the United Farm Worker Union made substantial progress in 
signing contracts with various growers. However, within hours after these contracts 
expired, the growers, without the prior consultation with UFWU, signed with the Western 
Conference of Teamsters. Nonetheless, the collusion between the growers and the 
Teamster union is being challenged by the Justice Department which is seeking 
indictmentsof Teamster union officials and lettuce growers on criminal charges alleging illegal cash 
payments to Teamster officials for the purpose of paying "security guards” to intimidate 
members of the UFWU. These "goons” were paid $67.50 per day to physically abuse 
farmworkers on strike in the Coachella Valley. On July 10th, this same union-busting 
tactic was used by the Gallo corporation when it signed with the Teamsters after holding 
a contract with the UFWU for six years. That same day, the United Farm Workers Union 
struck all Gallo ranches. Gallo is the largest producer of wines in the world, holding 45% 
of the total American wine market, with 30% of its sales in California. They have 
undertaken a massive advertising campaign aimed towards the “so called” youth 
market. Special emphasis is being placed on their youth oriented wines, such as 
Spanada, Boone’s Farm, Tyrollia, Ripple, etc. The fact that Gallo corporation relies so 
heavily upon the “youth market" provides us with an effective tool to use to convince 
Gallo that immediate secret elections should be held to determine whether the farmworkers 
want to be represented by the Teamster union or the Farm Workers Union. The Gallo Boycott can only be 
successful if you join efforts with us in coordinating a national boycott of all Gallo 
products. Student Body presidents, legislators, labor organizations and the clergy are 
lending their voices and support. We ask for your participation, or that of any campus 
organization, in the national boycott of Gallo products. Your aid is urgently and vitally 
needed to stop Gallo's efforts to smash the United Farm Worker Union. Please contact
