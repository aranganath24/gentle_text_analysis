Cinco de Mayo en Jalapa, Veracruz Mexico
In the annual Jalapeno Parade for 5 de Mayo thousands of people gather the streets to witness the revolutionary spirit of their heritage. Sharing similarities to
5 de Mayo celebration in Aztlan we can closely identify this spirit to that of ours. Men along with women partake in the same surge to stand the grounds for their Brown Eyed Children of the Sun.
