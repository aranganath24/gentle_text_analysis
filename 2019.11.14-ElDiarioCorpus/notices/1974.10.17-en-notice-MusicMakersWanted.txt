Music Makers Wanted
A portion of the community is interested in singing for the church. Their main objective is to keep our Chicano culture alive by having Mariachi Masses. Anyone who enjoys singing or playing a guitar, are welcome to participate.
Practice sessions are at 7 p.m. each Tuesday. Masses are held every Sunday at 12:30 p.m. St. Thomas Aquinas is located at 904 14 St in Boulder. For more information contact Ernest Jiron or Roberto Moran at 447-0852 or 444-0958.
