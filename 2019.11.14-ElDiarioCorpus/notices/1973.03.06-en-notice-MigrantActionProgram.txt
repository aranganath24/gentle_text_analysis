Migrant Action Program
The Migrant Action Program is an Educational Opportunity Program componant designed to help seasonal agricultural workers, migrants, or the sons or daughters of migrants to obtain a college degree. The MAP is also designed to provide a small community within the complex structure of the University so that a student can relate to people who have similar backgrounds. This assures that students will not feel lost at the University. The recruitment chairman is in charge of recruiting prospective students and sending them applications to fill out and return directly to him. Applicants must have the following qualifications: 1. He must be a migrant or seasonal agricultural worker or the son or daughter of a migrant or seasonal agricultural worker. 2. He must possess a GED Certificate or high school diploma.
3. He must be in need of financial aid. 4. He must have a sincere desire to obtain a college education. MAP seeks help from the Colorado Migrant Council, community action centers, and high school or vocational centers in searching for prospective applicants. Applicants are screened by a committee composed of MAP students, two from each area of the state, and one from out of state. For more on the application requirements see related information on this page. MAP has a tutoring and counseling coordinator and a student services chairman whose jobs are to provide services to those who may be having personal, financial, or academic difficulties. To help them, MAP now has 26 counsellers, who are also full time students, who undergo training sessions in order for them to be able to help their counsolees.
Interested persons can send credentials to Santiago Cordova MAP TB 1, University of Colorado.
