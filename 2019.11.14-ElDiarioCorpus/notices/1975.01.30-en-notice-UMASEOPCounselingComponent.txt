UMAS-EOP Counseling Component The counseling component currently employs twenty-five Peer Counselors. These counselors have at least one year’s experience within the university community. They are responsible for the dissemination of information related to the U.M.A.S. administrative supportive services and organization and the university community as a whole. This includes personal and academic assistance. Often the counselors will be able to handle the situation by themselves. In the event that they are unable to, they will be responsible for locating the appropriate agency or office and for referring the student to the same. For example, the Peer Counselors may be able to assist in the areas of financial aid applications, stipends, work study information, and class scheduling but for legal assistance they will refer the student to the appropriate agency or office. All first year U.M.A.S. students will be assigned a Peer Counselor. Those students whose academic standing is above a freshman will be assigned a regular Peer Counselor upon request, or they may simply go to the counseling office for “walk in” counseling.
