Chicano students and community people have began to organize a Boulder County 
Raza Unida Chapter. They will be affiliated with the State party and will focus on the 
needs of Boulder, Longmont and Lafayette citizens. The platform of the Raza Unida 
Party is simple and true; it states: Only through control of his life and community can 
any person or groups of people, combat and overcome poverty, injustice, inequality and 
racism. Therefore: It is the duty and responsibility of all people and groups of people, to 
seek and gain control of their lives and communities politically, economically, 
educationally and socially. The Chicano citizens in the Boulder area have not seen any 
action on the part of the local government. The problems remain the same, Anglo 
communities get richer and chicano communities remain at the bottom of the totem pole. 
If you are interested in helping organize the party, the next scheduled meeting will be 
Thur., September 13 at the Lafayette Chicano Center, 302 E. Simpson, Lafayette, Colo.
