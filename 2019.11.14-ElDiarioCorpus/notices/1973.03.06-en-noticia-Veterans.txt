Veterans The UMAS- and MAP-EOP components are interested in recruiting veterans. The G.I. Bill is of great assistance but does not cover the total expense of an education. This is where EOP can help. Under the programs, financial aid, based on need, is available; admission requirements are not based on past academic status; tutorial services are available; and counseling services are offered. Veterans need meet only the regular EOP requirements (see related information). Interested veterans can mail attached blank for further assistance.
