COPIRG (Colorado Public Interest Research Group) is a Ralph Nader inspired group which will be student-funded and student-controlled with a student elected board of directors. It will be your organization. Will fight racial and sexual discrimination, environmental destruction, consumer fraud and inadequate housing through lobbying and the courts. Will employ full-time professionals (Lawyers, researchers and community organizers) and student volunteers working for academic credit. It will provide the expertise, resources and continuity which the student movement has lacked in the past. It will be financed by a refundable fee of $2.25 per semester.
