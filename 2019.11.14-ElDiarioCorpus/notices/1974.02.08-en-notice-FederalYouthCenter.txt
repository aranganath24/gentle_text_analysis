Federal Youth Center BiMonthly visits are arranged for anyone who wants to go and help out our brother at the Federal Youth Center in Englewood. Most of them have no contact with the outside world except through us. Let’s let them know that we really care for them and that we mean it when we talk of "carnalismo.” If you would just like to come and see what it's all about, everyone is welcomed. For more information call Sister Bette at(transportation is provided if you call in advance.) UMAS-EOP has 3 work-study positions for secretaries. Contact Beverly Archuleta at
