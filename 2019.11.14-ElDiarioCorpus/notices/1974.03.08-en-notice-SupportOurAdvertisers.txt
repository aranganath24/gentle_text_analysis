Support our advertisers. Since August of 1972 we’ve been struggling to start and keep a viable Chicano publication going in Boulder. Most of the time this struggle has been an upward climb, but we’ve been aided greatly by the help of several Boulder and Denver businesses. These businesses are the ones you see in each issue of El Diario. For these people are the ones who help us pay the printing costs of our publication. This eight-page Diario that you are now reading will cost right around $3OO, and we’ll make just about that much in advertising revenue. For that $3OO you receive one of the few reliable news sources of interest to Chicanos. You can help us continue the publication of El Diario by taking your business to the firms that advertise with us. We Chicanos spend upwards of a million dollars a year in Boulder and much more than that in Denver, so we can help the business that helps El Diario pay its bills. So read our ads, and tell the businessmen who take a chance on us: "I saw your ad in El Diario."
