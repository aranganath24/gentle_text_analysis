Chavalone power Boycott Safeway! Boycott Safeway! Boycott Safeway! Huelga, huelga huelga! 

The chavalones are shouting the familiar phrases and are appearing in Boulder in numbers, 
from towns like Greeley, Pueblo, Monte Vista, etc. Chavalones ranging in age from two to seven 
are showing up in classes and on the picket lines and in the fields. It’s happening now and will 
be happening again and again. CHAVALONE POWER is here. The mass numbers of 
chavalones could make our current Chicano organizations seem small. The need for cultural 
awareness, bi-lingual education, and protection from racism and bigotry has never been greater, 
a project is being formulated for bilingual, mobile day-care centers, and will be pursued in the 
future. Support youth organizations! Viva los Chavalones! Aquel vato, Tu sabes?
