DENVER The Denver Area Peace and Justice Committee is planning to open a boycott campaign against local facilities and products of Stouffer’s Inc., a subsidiary of Nestle Co. Inc. Currently Nestle’s products are being boycotted for their promotion of baby formula in third world countries. It was initiated by concerned persons who wanted Nestle’s out of third world countries because their product was causing an incredible amount of infant deaths. Unsuspecting mothers are feeding Nestle’s milk to infants instead of breast feeding because it is easier, however it sometimes takes as much as one-fourth of the family’s budget to afford. Due to bad water and living conditions the milk formula is easily contaminated, causing sickness and often death. Nestle’s Corporation refuses to take their product out of these countries.
