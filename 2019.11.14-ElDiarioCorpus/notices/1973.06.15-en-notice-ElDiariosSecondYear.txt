El Diario's Second Year

With this issue of El Diario de la Gente we begin our second year of publication. El Diario was first published in August of 1972, succeeding a number of other UMAS publications. Since then we have published somewhat sporadically, but we finally settled down during the Spring '73 semester to a biweekly publication date. El Diario first editor, John Espinosa, has left for the summer semester to work with Cesar Chavez in Delano, California, on the United Farm Workers newspaper El Macriado. We will continue our coverage of Chicano news in the same objective manner which characterized our first year of publication. Most of the news Chicanos get from the established media is biased, sometimes unintentionally, because the reporter does not share our common heritage. El Diario hopes to overcome this problem by presenting all the news in as fair and accurate a manner as is possible. We cannot cover all the news without your help. We hope to work in close cooperation with UMAS-EOP supportive services and with you, the new summer students, to continue publication of the only reliable source of Chicano news in Boulder. Reporters, photographers, writers and just plain workers are all needed to help in the publication of El Diario. If you have a gift you can share with your raza, come and visit us in the University Memorial Center, room 416.
