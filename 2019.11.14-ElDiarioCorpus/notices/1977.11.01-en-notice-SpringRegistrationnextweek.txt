Spring Registration next weekUMAS-EOP reminds all students that preregistration for the upcoming Spring semester begins Tuesday, November 29 and continues through Friday December 2. UMAS-EOP will have academic advisers and counselors in the east ballroom of the UMC from 9:00-4:00 during the registration days to assist students with any questions or problems they may have. But most importantly we urge all students to come to our offices in Willard Hall to see your counselor before registering. For further information call 492-8316.
