The Boulder area committee for the Partido de La Raza Unida has been in the process 
of forming a County Chapter of the Colorado Partido de la Raza Unida. The committee 
has met four times to discuss ideologies and philosophies of the committee and also 
has participated in the last National and International Conference of the Partido de La 
Raza Unida held in Denver on August 1 7-19, 1973. Ideologies and philosophies are 
based on the 1972 Colorado State Platform and on the resolutions passed during the 
conference held in August, 1973. Following is a quote from the Introduction of the 
Colorado State Platform: “WE BELIEVE: It is man’s right-inherent with his existence to 
control and influence these factors that affect his life and his community. Only through 
control of his life and community can any person, or group of people, combat and 
overcome poverty, injustice, inequality and racism. "FURTHERMORE: It is the duty and 
responsibility of all people, and groups of people, to seek control of their lives and their 
communities in a manner beneficial to those living in that community. "THEREFORE: It 
is the right, responsibility and obligation of Chicanos, urban and rural, to seek and gain 
control of their lives and communities politically, economically, educationally and 
socially. “In accordance with this belief, it is our immediate
declaration that all institutions, organizations and agencies existing in, or purporting to 
exist for, Chicano communities become accountable to the people that are the basis of 
their existence." During the National and International Conference workshops were held 
to discuss such topics as Political Prisoners, Immigration policies, Nationalism and 
Internationalism, and International drug traffic problem. Presentations were made by 
Digna Sanchez of the Puerto Rican Liberation Movement, Corky Gonzalez of the 
Crusade for Justice speaking on the Colorado Partido de La Raza Unida and by 
representatives of the American Indian Movement (AIM). Several resolutions were 
passed concerning the position that the state Partido will take. The resolution passed 
out of the Political Structure workshop resolved that the Partido would align itself with 
the struggles of all peoples and demonstrate this solidarity by forming coalitions with all 
oppressed peoples throughout the world. Also, that they would support oppressed 
grassroot demonstrations and revolutionary actions of groups such as the American 
Indian Movement, Puerto Rico Libre, political activists who are imprisoned and other 
such groups. The Partido must at all times stand actively opposed to the U. S. 
Imperialism by supporting the liberation struggles of Third World Peoples and refusing 
to deal with the governments oppressing these peoples and by refusing to fight 
U.S. wars against these peoples. We, the Boulder Partido de La Raza Unida Organizing Committee 
adopt and support the State Partido Platform and Resolutions, and commit ourselves to actively 
organize around these efforts and principles. We solicit the support of any persons interested.
