Hermanos por sangre CHICANOS, your help is needed Recently UMAS established its own blood bank working in conjunction with the University Greek Blood Bank. Donors are needed in order that we have a surplus blood supply on hand. If one of our Chicano brothers or sisters is involved in an accident and needs a transfusion through our blood bank we would be able to help them greatly. Presently the UMAS Blood Bank has a total of two pints to our credit. Accidents can occur very unexpectedly please help us to be prepared. If anyone would like to share a pintcontact Dolores
