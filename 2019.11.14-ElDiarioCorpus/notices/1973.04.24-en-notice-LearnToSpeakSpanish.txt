LEARN TO SPEAK SPANISHA change in the academic year in Mexico is making it possible for CU to revise its regular Junior Year Abroad program to include applicants who have had only one year of college level Spanish or two years of high school Spanish. From September to December 1973 a one semester intensive language program will be held in Jalapa. Students will receive intensive Spanish languagetraining seminars in Mexican history culture and contemporary life taught in Spanish by Mexican professors. Students who have advanced sufficiently in their language ability will be able to enter the regular semester at the university of Vera Cruz that begins in January 1974 and a regular university curriculum will be available. A full years credit is guaranteed to those who complete the second semester.
