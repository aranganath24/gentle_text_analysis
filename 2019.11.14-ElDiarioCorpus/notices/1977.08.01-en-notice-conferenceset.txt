conference setThis conference can be a big step forward toward uniting all those who oppose the harassment and deportations of undocumented workers into a campaign of action in their defense. NSCAR is helping to organize support for this conference on a national scale, from Boston to San Diego and from Miami to Seattle. The San Antonio conference is planned as a forum ¡ªfor a full discussion of the issue, democratically-made decisions on a course of action, and the launching of a national campaign. To be successful, the conference must have the broadest possible sponsorship and participation from the Chicano community and those who support its struggle.
