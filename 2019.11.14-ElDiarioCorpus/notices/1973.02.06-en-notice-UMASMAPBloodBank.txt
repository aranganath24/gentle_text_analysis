UMAS-MAP blood bank
An UMAS-MAP Blood Bank is being established at the Greek Blood Bank at Wardenberg. The purpose is to establish a blood reserve to be used by all Chicanos at the University and in the surrounding community. The idea grew out of a request for blood to help a 3-year-old Chieanito cancer victim. He needed six pints to continue his struggle. It was announced at an UMAS meeting and I 2 persons agreed to contribute a pint of their blood. If you would like to add to this life-giving reserve contact the Greek Blood Bank at Wardenberg on Mondays from 1:3CM:30 p.m. or Tuesdays and Wednesdays from 6:30-8:30 p.m.
