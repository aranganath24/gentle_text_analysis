Boycott grapes!

Probably the majority of students are unaware of the extreme importance of this phase 
of the UFWs struggle for existence. Grape growers who three years ago signed 
contracts with the United Farm Workers Union have now signed sweetheart contracts 
with Teamsters' officials, and the two groups, in close coordination with government 
officials, are attempting to crush the only real hope the farmworkers have for social and 
economic equality. The growers were defeated not that long ago by a concentrated 
effort at many levels, the most important battle being waged by the consumers in the 
form of a grape boycott. While the Defense Department bought up huge amounts of 
grapes to offset the boycotts’ effects, the consumers, you and I, brought the growers to 
the negotiation table by refusing to eat the grapes of wrath, and helped the UFWU win 
its first battle. Only another hard fought battle against the amassed forces of the grape 
and lettuce growers, the Teamsters Union, the Safeway chain, and their government 
sycophants will bring justice to the farmworkers. We will spread the word to those in the 
far corners of Colorado: Boycott grapes!! Boycott lettuce!! Boycott Safeway!!
