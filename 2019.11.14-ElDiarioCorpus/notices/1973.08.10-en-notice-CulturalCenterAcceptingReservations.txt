Cultural Center accepting reservations

After several months of intensive preparations and plain hard work by a number of 
Chicanos, the combined Chicano-Indio Cultural Center and residence halls are 
accepting reservations for residence for the fall and spring semesters. The purchase of 
the two buildings, the Colonial and the Colony House at 1162 and 1146 12th street, is 
being coordinated by Gary Archuleta of Quetzacoatl Inc. "We’ve put an enormous 
amount of work into the Center,” Archuleta said, and called the project “successful so 
far.” A chicano-Indio cultural center has been one very important goal for many of the 
Chicano students attending CU. Recently Jose Calderon suggested that area Chicanos 
should provide a place for visiting lecturers where our guests could rest and eat. “We'll 
try to emphasize the cultural nature of the center,” Archuleta said, and spoke ot the 
plans for culturally-oriented activities. Among the activities planned are dance classes, 
art shows, and "the painting of a mural to rival that painted on the buildings at the 
University of Mexico," Archuleta said. During the summer months the Center was used 
for several important meetings, including a meeting between members of the Boulder 
city government and local Chicanos to discuss charges of police harrassment, plus a 
visit by Alurista, the renowned Chicano poet and author. Since the concept is an almost 
perfect example of ’living education,’ there are hopes that an accredited program can be 
offered this fall for residents of the two buildings. The program will depend on student 
involvement. What are the requirements for living at the Center? "University regulations 
say you have to be 21 to live off campus when you’re a freshmen," Archuleta said. 
Room and board costs at the residence halls will be "compatible with the rates offered 
by University dormitories,” Archuleta said, and noted that the dorms arc thinking of 
raising prices to cope with higher food prices. “Our prices will remain competitive with 
the Universitys’," Archuleta said. If you are interested in applying for a reservation at the
