Augustine O. Cordova and Raymond Garcia will be in charge of the MAP Biblioteca this

and from 9:00 a.m. on Friday. The library is well stocked with novels, textbooks and files 
on current events and relevant topics such the Farmworkers’ Plight and other Mexican 
American data. A system of checking out books has been organized, books are made 
available for overnight reading by stopping by the Biblioteca in TB No. 1. The services of the 
Biblioteca are available to all MAP students and their families. Cordova and Garcia 
would like to thank Miguel Duran for his contribution of books to the Biblioteca. 
Everyone is reminded that you can recycle your books by donating them to the MAP 
Biblioteca for use by all others in the future. For information call either of the Librarians
