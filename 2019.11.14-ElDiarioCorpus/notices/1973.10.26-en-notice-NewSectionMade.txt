New section made

Nick Cisneros, member of the Colorado Student Lobby, informed MAP students of a 
new minority section formulated in the lobby. Cisneros went on to add that it would be 
meaningful to community by adding the minority section. The Colorado Student Lobby 
needs input, new ideas and problems affecting the minority so that they (CSL) can 
effectively attempt to solve and present problems to the State Legislature. Cisneros 
stressed the importance of students contacting him. He can be reached at ext. 8852.
