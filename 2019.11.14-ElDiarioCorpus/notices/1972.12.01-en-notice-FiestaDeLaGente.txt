Fiesta de la Gente
UMAS (United Mexican American Students) and the Cultural Events Board at the Boulder campus of the University of Colorado will host four days of Chicano activities starting Thursday November 30th December 3rd. The purpose of this four day event is to create a greater understanding of the Chicano Culture. This opportunity to experience some aspects of the Chicano Culture will hopefully result in the development of an awareness and appreciation for Chicano Culture. The entire program is open to the public. The only charge is for food and drink.
