COPIRGlllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllilllilllllllllllllllllllllll sCOPIRG, Colorado Public Interest Research Group, a non-profit consumer and minority action organization is embarking on a petition drive. Beginning the second week of April, COPIRG will hold a petition drive on the CU campus to get the signatures of a majority of students in support of COPIRG. If approved, COPIRG would be financed through refundable student fees and would hire a professional staff to do research and prepare litigation in the public interest. Some possible projects for COPIRG to research include: the development of oil shale, food industry regulation, race and sex discrimination, appliance and automobile repairs, and tenant-landlord relations. Currently, there are PIRGs operating in many states across the country. COPIRG needs volunteers to help us petition and get organized. There will be a meeting this Friday, April 6 at 4 p.m. in UMC 157. For more information call 447-0115 or 449-7163.
