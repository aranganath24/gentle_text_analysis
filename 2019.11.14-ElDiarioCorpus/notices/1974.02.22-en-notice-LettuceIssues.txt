Lettuce Issues. The Farm Labor Task Force has recently been working on an Educational campaign to inform the students on the present situation involving the return of non-union lettuce on campus. We are in desperate need of help in operating a telephone campaign, informational pickets and leafleting. The students will have the opportunity to voice their opinion on the February 26-27th and the decision will lie in their hands. If you could possibly help with any of the above please contact the F.L.T.F. in the UMC 186, ext. 8437.
