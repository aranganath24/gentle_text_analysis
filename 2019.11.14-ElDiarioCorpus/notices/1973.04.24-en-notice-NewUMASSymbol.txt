Chicano Artists We wish to solicit assistance and draftsmanship in design of a new symbol for UMAS. Guide lines are that it should reflect the Mestizo (Chicano) of today with emphasis on the Indian ancestry of his past. The symbol should also represent the goals and resolutions of UMAS students today projected into the future. Please submit the sketches or finished work to Room 187 UMC before Mav 4. 1973.
