El Diario positions 
El Diario is currently interviewing for a limited number of positions on the most successful Chicano newspaper in Colorado. Reporters, both beginning and advanced, photographers, advertising workers, artists and cartoonists, and others are needed. The new UMAS class of freshmen don’t have a single student working for El Diario, making the paper top-heavy with upperclassmen. If you would like to apply for one of the very few work study slots El Diario will be alloted this fall, you must begin working now. If you have no experience, we can train you for any of the positions. Come up and talk to us in room 416 of the UMC, or call us ext. 8836.
