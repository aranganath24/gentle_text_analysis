School Board Elections Pete Garcia, a Boulder County Mental Health councelor, is seeking a school board seat from District F. The election is set for May 1. Registration deadline is March 30. The election is a non-partisan election and the board members are elected at large. This means everyone can vote for their candidate, even if he doesn’t live in their district. If you voted in the November 7, general election you are registered already. If not, get out and register. We need a Chicano voice in the educational system which molds our children’s futures.
