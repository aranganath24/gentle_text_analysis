The UMAS organization would like to remind all summer students that they have an obligation to participate in the function of their student organization. As we have mentioned before, financial aid has always made the effort to delay our awards to encourage us to leave this institution. Because all summer students have had to deal with financial aid this year, you should be aware that it's a continuous struggle. Therefore, it's up to us to do something about it this summer, so it can be better for us this fall. Also remember that there's an attack on our Chicano Studies Programs. Come to the Board of Directors Meeting next Monday night and voice your opinion! The meeting is at 6:00 P.M. in the UMC Room 158. Sin Mas UMAS Board of Directors
