LA Vida Es Un Sueno:

The University Theatre will have tryouts for their next main stage production, Life Is A Dream, March 5-7. This Spanish play was written by Pedro Calderon de la Barca during the siglo de oro and combines the passion and romance of Spain. Persons should read the play and have two passages thoroughly prepared prior to the tryouts. The play has a cast of four women, nine men, and two guitarists who can play in the Spanish manner. The director, Dr. Edgar Reynolds, is looking for people with “good voices, clean diction, strong movement, imagination, and passion.” Scripts are on reserve in Norlin Library under Dr. Reynolds. Performance dates for Life Is A Dream are April 20-22, 26-28.
