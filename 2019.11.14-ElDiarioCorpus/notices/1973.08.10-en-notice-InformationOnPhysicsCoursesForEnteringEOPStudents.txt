Information on Physics Courses for Entering EOP Students

Information on Physics Courses for Entering EOP Students There are two physics 
courses which should be of major interest to entering EOP students. 1. Physics 101-102 
This course is especially designed for educationally disadvantaged students, i.e., 
students with a weak background in science and mathematics. It satisfies one year of 
the natura science requriement and has controlled enrollment. Completion of Physics 
101-102 precludes a student from taking either Physics 103-104 or 201-202 but not 
Physics 111-112. Students who need Physics 201-202 for their major may in some 
circumstances take just Physics 101-102 or in other cases the Physics 101-102, 303. 
The student should check either with Professor Allan Franklin, the Physics 101-102 
instructor, or the department involved. 2. "Stretched" Physics 111 This is the first 
semester of the regular introductory physics sequence for engineers, physical science 
majors and pre-medical students. The material is spread out over two semesters and 
has been reorganized to allow a student who will not take either Math 130 or Applied 
Math 131 until the second semester to take the course. It should be emphasized that 
students will have to take either Math 30 or Applied Math 131 during the second 
semester. Students will receive an 1C in the course at the end of the first semester and 
should make sure that they can schedule the continuation during the second semester. 
Students must complete both semesters to receive credit for Physics 111. Students who 
wish to take this stretched version of Physics 111 should register for either Physics 111 
- Section 4 which is open to all EOP students or Physics 111 - Section 5 which is 
restricted to BEP students. In the event of insufficient registration, the two sections will 
be combined but at least one section of stretched Physics 111 will be offered in the fall. 
Students with weak backgrounds may take Physics 101-102 before proceeding with 
either the stretched or regular versions of Physics 111. Sections 4 and 5 are controlled 
enrollment.
