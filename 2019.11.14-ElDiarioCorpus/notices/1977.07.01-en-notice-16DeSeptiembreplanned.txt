16 De Septiembre planned
Several organizations from Boulder are meeting to plan a Mexican Independence Day Celebration to be held September 17. The planners of the festival hope to promote the talents of Chicanos in Boulder. A parade is planned and everyone is encouraged to
construct a float and dress in traditional costumes. Those who wish to participate must contact the planning committee by August 12, by calling 499-0359 or 4427669. Everyone is invited and need not be representing an organization.
