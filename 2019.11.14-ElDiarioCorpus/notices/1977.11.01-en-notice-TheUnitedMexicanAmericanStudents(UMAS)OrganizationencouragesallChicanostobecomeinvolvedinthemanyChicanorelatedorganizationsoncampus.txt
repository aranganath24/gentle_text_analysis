The United Mexican American Students (UMAS) Organization encourages all Chicanos to become involved in the many Chicano related organizations on campus. Rewarding experiences doing work pertaining to your major which contributes to the benefit of fellow Chicanos await. Information on the various organizations can be obtained by visiting the UMAS office in room 186 of the UMC or stopping by the UMAS booth in the UMC loggia. Again a reminder to UMAS students to attend the Board of Directors meetings held every Monday in UMC 158 and General Assembly meetings, which times and places will be posted.
