What’s the Ombudsman Office? We are unbiased mediators working as a liaison between students/faculty/ and staff. We’re the people to see when you don’t know where to go for help. Our staff provides information, makes referrals, and listens to complaints at the Ombudsman Outreach Booth which is located in the U.M.C. lobby. The Ombudsman Office helps you resolve problems in areas such as in-state tuition, financial aid, grade appeals and other academic grievances, admissions and records, University police, student employment and general institutional problems.
