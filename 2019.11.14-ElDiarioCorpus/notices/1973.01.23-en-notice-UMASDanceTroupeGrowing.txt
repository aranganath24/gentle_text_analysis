UMAS dance troupe growing
It looks like the colorful UMAS dance group which performed at the Fiesta De la Gente last semester will be expanding their program. On January 26 they will travel to Grand Junction where they will perform for that community. The program is being sponsored by La Voz de la Raza. a newly developed community
program Which provides the Western Slope with cultural and Raza entertainment via radio, television and concerts. The group is looking for new membership. Dance instruction is being offered through the physical education department. All members of the dance troupe must be enrolled in either the beginning or the advanced classes. For further information on the classes see either Eileen Torrez or Claudia Jasper at UMC 187. Dance instruction is also being offered for children ranging in ages from 5 to 10. The classes will be conducted at Lincoln Elementary. All parents interested in enrolling their children should contact the above instructors.
