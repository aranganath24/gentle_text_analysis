Boycott volunteers needed
The boycott of Safeway stores in Boulder is a month old. To date the boycott has been effective, but it could be even more so with more volunteers. Picketing activities have been restricted to Saturdays because of a shortage of picketers. The Farm Labor Task Force is willing to meet and give a presentation to any group wanting more information about the boycott. Any groups willing to man the picket lines one day a week are asked to call 443-221 I ext. 6572-1 for more information. i
