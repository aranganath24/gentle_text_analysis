<h1><span class="header-section-number">7</span> Bigrams</h1>
<p>Sometimes, you will be more interested in tokenizing your text data using a different unit of analysis than the single word. There are any number of ways to tokenize a text data collection besides a single word. A simple extension of tokenizing with a single word is tokenizing by two consecutive words, which is a unit of analysis known as a bigram.</p>
<p>In this section, we’ll extend the material in previous sections of the workshop, and learn how to extract and clean bigrams (i.e. consecutive words) from a data collection, develop a simple bigram frequency table, and visualize bigrams using <em>ggplot2</em>.</p>

<h2><span class="header-section-number">7.1</span> Extracting bigrams from a text corpus and creating a bigram frequency table</h2>
<p>In order to extract our bigrams, we’ll return to the <code>diario_creatives_tidy</code> dataset we created above, in which each row is associated with a distinct text document from the collection, and the text data for each document is contained in a separate column. Let’s remind ourselves of this dataset’s structure, by bringing it up again in the RStudio data viewer:</p>

To the tecatos in La Plaza Jarvis lost in their world of the bizarre. Escaping to the ranks of the militants, honored by fast flying bullets and dying brothers and sisters. To the anger of a lost forgotten poet whose poems are like that of a machine gun blasts. To the burning fields of the campesinos chained by the greed of the land lords of America Incorporation. Down the madness of lost alleys of the young disgusted at the never known constant plague of wars that have followed him, his father and grandfather, and will follow each of us to our graves. History raped beauty of the mind as men destroy and build you to their absurd desires. Books that spit at my face uncertain and confused facts. Money which is false and empty as these men who rule this so called free country of the world. Weeping children of the world that twine for survival. Aching heart beats that listen for death’s dark curtain. Unknown sunlight that circles this artificial world provided by Dupont or Kodack. Strange soil, steel empty people without colour, without faces, without your minds slowly marching never asking why. Drained of love, anger, joy and hate. Freedom and revolutions become lifeless as the wallpaper to be used in all federal office buildings as you stupid idot human machines march in. You flash and roll, move and produce your answer from your memory banks carefully selected. How many are there, how many are left?

When he found a campfire’s glow. His heart thumped with delight For now he would get his prey. Possibly without a fight. He sneaked into the camp With the stealth of a cat, But his intentions and thoughts Were those of a rat. He drew his trusty Colt And fired into the slumbering victim. And a wide grin crossed His weathered face as he kicked 'im. Then a look of surprise came Upon the good Ranger’s face For this was not the man That he was to chase. As he mounted his trusty steed And rode off into the horizon. He thought, “No harm done. He was only another Mexican.” \"Once again. Good and Justice Have triumphed.” Gerald Tafoya","A NEW LEGEND! EL RATON\nI was walking down the street in a town called Nowsville, Siberia. It seemed to be very quiet at the time, when all of a sudden I heard a rat munching on some goat cheese. Now what would a rat be doing eating hard goat cheese near a wine bottle at about four fifteen and a half in the morning? I walked up to this rat and I said, “Scat, rat.” He said “Why don’t you blow, bro.” We got into a heavy rap about how old he was and where he came from. All he said was I should mind my own business. I started to cry and said to\nmyself, “That cat, I mean rat, just called me a blow bro, or, I should say, he said, ‘Why don’t you blow, bro.\" I said to myself, “Bummer, bummer.” So I picked him up by his left foot and said, “Listen here, you rat. Don’t ever call me down like that,” and he said, “Bueno, Bro.” 1 asked the rat, “Where can I find a place to sleep?” He said, “There’s a town fifteen miles north northeast of here.” I said, “What is the name of this town?” And the rat said,“l don’t know, bro.” So I told the rat, “It was nice meeting you, rat,” and all he did was bite me on my left knee and ran away.

The lovely velvet rag That used to be a dress Into the yellow bag went For Goodwill Industries. The owners had refused To use them one more time To save them further abuse. How old is old? How new is new? New gets old And old can get renewed. The three-wheel bike That a little boy would ride Was priced into a box For Goodwill Industries. The Garcia fishing rod That caught its share of fish Into the collection box went For Goodwill Industries. How old is old? How new is new? Who can say? The boy who rode the bike Grew up to be a man.

It should be the salad bowl of the world. The term, melting pot, means that America is a blending of different cultures races, customs, beliefs all stirred up and blended together to form one country that lives in harmony. Bullwinkle. How can different races live together, still hold their customs, beliefs, and cultural heritage, and live in harmony as one people? The only way would be if everybody gave up the very things that make them a race. In a salad you have different things mixed up, but still whole, still identifiable. Like, say, olives for Blacks, tomatoes for Indians, lemons for Chinese, bleached mushrooms for Whites, and golden, crisp, delicious apples baked juicy brown or Chicanos, all having different flavors like races with their different vibrations about life. In America today you have Blacks, Chinese, Indians, and Chicanos all fighting for their self-concept their lost culture. Nobody wants to be melted into something he can’t identify with.

Daniel Cavazos","Mad Genie Terrorizes Neighborhood\nFAIRY TALE In more ancient times, around the countries of the middle east, when people still believed in the unreal in the days of sultans and eunuchs, according to many still existing legends, there was a unique class of creatures called genies. As many of you know, these creatures were able to perform all sorts of weird things in order to fulfill their masters every wish. The genies you see lived in a magic lamp or lantern and whoever had it had the power to get the genies to serve them, many of us today of course can’t believe in genies, mostly because none have been seen for quite some time. Thus, it was with great surprise that the people of Duskrack 9 discovered that they were in possession of one of these fabulous creatures. Some time ago this genie came to people claiming he would serve them as they had never before known possible. Now, you might get pictures in your head about what this genie looked like, so I better set you straight. First of all, it’s pretty hard to find a magic lamp or lantern or magic anything these days. So when it came to finding a home for himself, the genie had to make do with and old Coors bottle. And even though the genie had his roots in more ancient ways he was also a product of modern times. No, no turban or turkish robe for him instead he wore a black tie and on his head this cute Gl-type crewcut. Now I know what you’re thinking— “that couldn’t be a genie” well, that’s what some of us started saying as we waited for him to start fulfilling our wishes and desires. As time would go on, the name of this creature would echo on the streets during riots: the genie’s name would be whispered in bars; his face would appear in newspaper cartoons; and dogs and cats would discuss his virtues as\nthey did their daily thing. In local folklore, people would immortalize GENIE DA MEANIE. When he first came to the people of duskrack 9, he said things like he would treat “the whole dustrack and all its citizens with an open-door policy.” He said he wanted to “maintain the integrity of the neighborhood.\" He said that with more recreation facilities for the kids, drug abuse and crime would go down and that he would in fact work for such facilities. Now, if you’re bored with this information, don’t blame me. I’m only writing what he really said. I know if may sound like the rhetoric of unfilled political promises but then I suppose every genie has a little politician in him and vice versa. Well, let’s start at the beginning. Since most of you have never seen the old style of genie and a few of you have never seen Da Meanie, I’ll tell you what he looked that first day we found his magic Coors bottle in the Denver Stockyard garbage bin. A couple of us had been walking down this alley toking when we noticed the bottle dead center in front of us. It sounded like it was humming to get our attention. We held it up to the light (it was still unopened) and could see a small, black, greasy, kinky pile in the bottle. God knows how many times we’ve wished we hadn’t touched it. Well, anyway. As the bottle opened a hissing noise, a black smoke and a nasty smell (it reminded you of very rotten pork) mushroomed out the top and knocked us on our asses. And then the magic words, \"Your wish is my command.” And that’s when he started making all the promises. Well of course we listened, we had to. You understand. Later he was brought before the entire community and even though a lot of those dumb Mexicans objected, he was ac-\ncepted. There were some things about him no one knew then that only came out later. This was after he had attacked the high priest Lara since magicians can’t get along with peace-loving priests. One thing I found out later was how he had happened to come to us. It seems that many many years before, Genie da Meanie arrived by boat from the old country. This isn’t the important part. What does matter is that while he was on the ship, he made a pact with a bunch of notorious little gremlin called Mufias. The Mufias were a special breed of gremlins who today have unusual amount of influence over genies and their mortal counterparts, the politicians. Unfortunately, Genie da Meani more often than not would honor his pact with the Mufias rather than his promises to the community. Nobody had asked him to make all those promises. As a matter of fact, a lot of people didn’t even want him around. It was his own decision. So when he started beating people up, we started\ntrying to get rid of him. One night some of the kids in the neighborhood took out their frustration on buildings by firebombing them. The kids had no jobs to work, they didn’t have enough recreation facilities (Genie da Meanie never came through) and they were being hassled by the cops. Then Genie da Meanie came out with the statement that the cops should \"unshackled\" to take care of those \"young hoodlums who are terrorizing the neighborhood.\" What he meant was that the cops should teach the kids a lesson by beating them up. Well, that was the last straw. The people of Dustrack 9 brought their grievances to the town elders hoping to find a solution. The town elders weren’t about to do anything though. A lot of them were pretend-Genies and if the people could get rid of da Meanie, then who would be next. Thousand of signatures were brought before the town elders demanding that Genie da Meanie be thrown out. But the rules that had been set down weren’t intended to get rid of genies. They were designed to complicate, to frustrate. Now, I’ll agree we have to have laws and procedures but when Genie da Meanie said all the signatures weren’t any good, he was missing the point. He had his\nchance to be a likeable genie and he blew it. Not many of us ever get that chance. So, the people learned, after a lot of effort, that this isn’t the country it’s supposed to be. They made up their minds to take over the Dustrack by force. And Genie da Meanie? Well, we haven’t seen him for some time now. It seems that one of those ecology kids saw a Coors bottle in a office and with good intentions, took it down to be recycled. So as this fairy tale ends here, I’d like to ask you to be careful. Things have changed for better since the people have taken over. We’ve got everything that Genie da Meanie ever promised us. So as favor to the people, stay away from Coors bottles. Don't drink it. Don’t buy it. Don’t even open a bottle. Even if you don’t believe in genies.","vocalist featured\nRita Dolores Orona, a music major at CU, has been selected soloist singer for Puccini’s opera “Mi Chiamano Mimi\" which will be on the Honor's Concert program for January 26.

The boiler/furnace of the Escuela has been damaged beyond repair and is obsolete, therefore, it will have to be replaced at the cost of at least $20,000.00. Presently, school time will have to be made up on Saturdays and Sundays for the days lost due to cold weather, cold rooms, no furnace and fear for our children getting sick. Preparations are being made to continue classes at individual’s homes, until the furnace repairs are completed. ESCUELA TLATELOLCO asks you for your Chicano Pledge and ask that you place an order for the Epic Poem “I am Joaquin” from the Escuela’s Aztlan Bookstore, 1567 Downing Street, Denver, Colorado 80218. fti m in K “I am Joaquin” “I am Joaquin was the first work of poetry to be published by Chicanos for Chicanos and is the forerunner of the Chicano cultural renaissance . . . The sounds of movement, the literary and anthropological quest for our roots, the renewal of a fierce pride and tribal unity, are the reasons why I Am Joaquin had to be shared with all my hermanos y bermanas, fathers, mothers, and grandparents. Their time, and now our time, could not be left behind and forgotten.\" Rodolpho Gonzales. ","Our Chicano Heritage\nLa Llorona weeps on!\n“God...in his immense goodness began to send Messengers and signals from heaven, foretelling the Spaniards coming. These caused great fear in this new world, for ten years before the Spaniards came to this land...many times and many nights one heard a woman's voice that wept loudly and drowned her speech in cries, and sighs “Oh my children! We shall be completely lost\" ...and other times she would say: “Oh my children, where can I hide you?” Diego Munoz Carmargo For countless generations the legend of La Uorona has been an integral part of the Chicano Heritage. Where did her story begin? Some say that she was the Az,tec goddess Matlaciuatl' a vampire-like creature who stalks desolate places preying and feeding on men. Others say she was Ciuapipiltin, a goddess who ventured forth at midnite carrying an empty cradle, looking and lamenting for her lost child. And many claim that La Llorona is La Malinche, the Indian mistress of Cortes, who eternally laments the betrayal of her people. Whoever or whatever she is, her story is a major part of Chicano folklore. In that space between fantasy and reality, La Llorona is poised, always alert for her release. But strange enough La Llorona may not be limited just to La Chicanda. There exists in Hebrew tradition a female demon known as Lilith. It is said that she “is the strangler of children and the seducer ot men.” Her story dates back as far as Adam and Eve. The Lilith myth begins with the first wife of Adam who, because of a dispute, left him. At Adam’s request, God sent three angels to bring her back and threatened that if she did not return, 100 of her sons were to be destroyed each day. She refused, saying she was expressley created to harm new born babies. God then commanded her to roam the earth for eternity and so Lilith shares her misery by threatening pregnant women and new born babies. La Llorona is of a like spirit. The most common-place belief *is that La Llorona wanders over the Earth lamenting over her lost children This legend began with the Spanish Conquistidor Cortes, who took the Indian maiden Marina, (La Malinche) as his mistress. When Cortes was to return to Spain he wanted to take their son, Hernando, back to Spain with him. La Malinche swore she would kill both herself and their son before she would allow this. When Cortes remained adament, La Malinche stabbed her son to death and then stabbed herself. As she died, her soul escaped from her body issuing a loud lament. To this day her loud wailing is still heard near Chicano communities, as she continues her search for her dead son.","The police force being unable to capture el tortilla kid for the brutal beating he gave two police officers have sent for the son of that great all American George Wally but it appears that everyone is in for a surprise.\nIn the office of the chief of police.\nHello I'm George Wally Jr. \nJesus Christ No, No.\nWho did you expect?

<p>Now, let’s extract the rough draft of a bigram frequency table using the same <code>unnest_tokens()</code> and <code>count()</code> functions that we used above to generate our single word frequency table.</p>
<p>In the code below, we:</p>
<ul>
<li>First take <code>diario_creatives_tidy</code>, and then use the <code>unnest_tokens()</code> function to tokenize the text data in the “text” column of <code>diario_creatives_tidy</code> as bigrams. Instead of setting the token equal to “words” (as above), we set <code>token="ngrams"</code>, and <code>n=2</code>, which, taken together, effectively tokenize the data by consecutive words (i.e. as bigrams). The name of the column containing the bigrams in the tokenized dataset is set to “bigram” (i.e. <code>output=bigram</code>).</li>
<li>We then take this tokenized dataset, and, using the <code>%&gt;%</code> operator, feed this tokenized dataset into the <code>count()</code> function to generate a bigram frequency table.</li>
<li>Finally, we’ll assign this bigram frequency table to a new object named <code>diario_bigram</code>:</li>

<h2><span class="header-section-number">7.2</span> Cleaning a bigram frequency table</h2>
<p>Let’s now clean our bigram frequency table in the same way that we did above, for the word frequency table (Section 5.3): by removing any bigrams that include a Spanish or English stopword or a number. In broad strokes, the process of cleaning a bigram frequency table in this manner is very similar to cleaning a word frequency table.</p>
<p>One difference, at the outset, however, is that because a bigram consists of two words, we will temporarily separate out our bigrams into two columns, and clean these columns individually before merging our bigrams back together.</p>
<p>In the code below, we use the <code>separate()</code> function to separate out the words in the “bigram” column of <code>diario_bigram</code> into two columns, named “word1” and “word2”, where the separator is a blank space in between words (<code>sep=" "</code>). We’ll assign this new dataset, with the bigrams separated, to a new object named <code>diario_bigram_separated</code>:</p>

<p>In the code below, we take <code>diario_bigram_separated</code>, and then sequentially remove English stopwords from the “word1” and “word2” columns, and Spanish stopwords from the “word1” and “word2” columns. The technique we use to remove these words, using the <code>filter()</code> function to subset rows within <code>diario_bigram_separated</code> which do NOT contain any of the specified stopwords, is exactly the same as what we used above to remove stopwords from our word frequency table. The data frame that results from removing the stopwords from <code>diario_bigram_separated</code> is assigned to a new object named <code>diario_bigram_filtered</code>:</p>

<p>Now, let’s remove numbers from the “word1” and “word2” columns in <code>diario_bigram_filtered</code>.</p>
<p>First, we’ll parse the “word1” column from <code>diario_bigram_filtered</code> for numbers, and assign the output vector to a new object named <code>diario_bigram_word1numbers</code>:</p>

<p>We’ll now add the <code>diario_bigram_word1numbers</code> and <code>diario_bigram_word2numbers</code> vectors to the <code>diario_bigram_filtered</code> dataset as columns:</p>

<p>This yields an updated version of <code>diario_bigram_filtered</code>, which now contains information on whether the the text in the columns “word1” and “word2” have numbers. More specifically, the column “diario_bigram_word1numbers” takes the value " NA" for any word in “word1” that does not contain numbers, and the column “diario_bigram_word2numbers” similarly takes on “NA” values for any word in “word2” that does not contain numbers. To confirm this, please view <code>diario_bigram_filtered</code> in the RStudio data viewer (<code>View(diario_bigram_filtered)</code>).</p>
<p>We’ll leverage this information to delete all rows in <code>diario_bigram_filtered</code> for which “word1” or “word2” contains a number. In particular, we’ll do this by taking <code>diario_bigram_filtered</code>, and subsetting all rows in which the “diario_bigram_word1numbers” has an NA value (which excises rows in which “word1” contains a number) using the ``filter()<code>function, and then subsequently using the same procedure to subset all rows in which "diario_bigram_word2numbers" has an NA value (which excises rows in which "word2" contains a number). We'll assign these changes back to the same</code>diario_bigram_filtered``` object, and thereby update the previous contents of the objects.</p>

<p>First, we’ll use the <code>unite()</code> function to paste the separate words in “word1” and “word2” back into one column as bigrams. The code below takes <code>diario_bigram_filtered</code>, and then calls the <code>unite()</code> function. The first argument, <code>bigram</code>, is the desired name of the new column that results from pasting the columns together. The second and third arguments, <code>word1</code> and <code>word2</code> are the columns that we’d like to unite within the new “bigram” column, and the final argument regarding the desired separator (<code>sep=" "</code>) indicates that the words in the “word1” and “word2” columns are to be pasted into the “bigram” column with a space in between them.

<p>First, we’ll take <code>diario_bigram_frequency_final</code> and use the <code>slice_max()</code> function to extract the bigrams with the ten highest frequencies (i.e. the ten highest values of “n”). We’ll assign this subsetted dataset to a new object named <code>diario_bigram_top_ten</code>:</p>

<p>Let’s view <code>diario_bigram_top_ten</code> in the data viewer:</p>

</p>
<p>Now, let’s use <code>diario_bigram_top_ten</code> to create a horizontal bar chart of the most frequently ocurring bigrams, and assign it to a new object named <code>bigram_graph</code>:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb58"><pre class="sourceCode r"><code class="sourceCode r"><span id="cb58-1"><a href="bigrams.html#cb58-1" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a><span class="co"># Creates sideways bar chart of 10 most frequently ocurring bigrams</span></span>

<p>The code used to generate <code>bigram_graph</code> above is almost identical to the code used to generate the sideways bar chart in Section 6.1. The only difference is the final line of code, which uses the <code>scale_y_continuous()</code> function to set custom tick marks for the axis on which frequencies are displayed.</p>
<p>Let’s now take a look at <code>bigram_graph</code>:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb59"><pre class="sourceCode r"><code class="sourceCode r"><span id="cb59-1"><a href="bigrams.html#cb59-1" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a><span class="co"># prints &quot;bigram_graph&quot;</span></span>
